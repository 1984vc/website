The Series A round is typically the most  dilutive round for founders primarily because the Series A investors have high ownership target and demand a large option pool to build a strong team. But there are strategies that founders can use to lower that dilution

Ultimately, the best defense against dilution is execution: the better the company performs, the higher its valuation, and the more cards a founder has during the negotiation. But beyond executing your way to high valuations, here are a few other ideas:

## 1. Negotiate down the lead’s ownership

Series A leads often start negotiations with high ownership targets—typically 12-15% but some as high as 20%. These numbers are always up for negotiation. If the proposed capital is more than you actually need, try to negotiate down the round size (or if you have other investors you want to bring, the lead investor’s check size)  As mentioned, your best best negotiating tactic is Demonstrating strong traction and growth potential. But at the end of the day the best negotiation tactic is having options. 

# 2. Get a second term sheet

A second term sheet (or BATNA - Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) is your best negotiation tactic. It provides leverage by showing other investors are interested, It creates competition, and it gives you options if negotiations with the lead investor fall through

To get a second term sheet while maintaining professionalism:

- Create urgency by setting a clear timeline for your fundraising process
- When speaking with investors, mention you're in advanced discussions without naming specific firms
- Focus on your company's strengths and growth potential rather than other offers
- Use phrases like "we're seeing strong interest" or "we're in late-stage discussions with several firms"

Remember, the goal is to generate genuine interest, not to simply shop around an existing offer. Be transparent about your process while maintaining discretion about specific details.

It’s pretty straightforward. But in reality it can be a challenge. As a founder, 

# 3. Offer other attractive terms

 like board seats or information rights, major investor rights, in exchange for lower ownership. But don’t offer super pro rate 

## 2. Negotiate a Smaller Option Pool

Investors often require a company to set aside a significant option pool (10%-12%) for future employees, which dilutes existing shareholders. Negotiating a smaller option pool (say 5-8%).  However, expect significant investor push back!

## 3. Limit Pro Rata Rights for Early Investors

Seed fund investors typically ask for pro rata rights, but it's advisable to only grant these rights to your larger investors—typically those who have invested $500K or more. This ensures that only significant investors can maintain their ownership percentage, thereby limiting the overall dilution in your next round

## 4. Re-negotiate Pro Rata Rights for Early Investors

Investors understand that founders can be very sensitive towards dilution particularly if the round starts to balloon.  Often founders can go back to their existing investors during the round and ask them to relinquish part or all their pro-rata rights. 

## 5. Negotiate a founder grant

Another approach is to agree with the lead investor on the option pool but also ask that a small percentage, say 1% or 2%, are granted to the founder post financing.  Investors often push back, and the founder needs a legitimate reason for the ask.  

# 6. Raise a Larger Seed Round

One way to minimize dilution is to raise a larger Seed round or a follow-on seed extension with small dilution to the founder. By securing more capital during the seed stage, you can delay the need for Series A funding, giving your company more time to grow and potentially achieve a higher valuation, which in turn reduces the dilution percentage when you do raise Series A.

## 7. Have Fewer Co-founders

It’s no secret that first-time founders tend to have multiple co-founders, resulting in reducing their initial ownership substantially.  More seasoned founders tend to have at most one co-founder and retain the majority of the cap table at founding. 

Remember, negotiation is a normal part of the fundraising process. With clear communication and a strong value proposition, you can often find a middle ground that works for both parties.
