One of the misconceptions in that a priced round is better from a dilution standpoint for a founder than a standard Post-Money Safe.  In reality, the outcome depends on a number factors that most founders wonâ€™t have a good command of at the time theyâ€™re raising their first Safe.  These are:

- How many SAFE rounds will you raise
- How much option pool will the Series Pre-Seed investor demand
- Whether a founder will depart the company before the next priced round

Letâ€™s dive into these in more detail.  

## Introduction to SAFEs

First introduced by YCombinator in 2013, A SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) is an investment instrument  that is simpler and more streamlined than a traditional priced round. When fundraising with SAFEs,  investors donâ€™t receive immediate shares. Instead, theyâ€™re promised future shares of stock at the next priced round in exchange for their current investment. 

But when multiple SAFE rounds are raised in succession, the dilution effects of these SAFEs can differ from those in equivalent priced rounds. Hereâ€™s how this works. 

## Priced Round Dilution Across Multiple Rounds

Imagine A VC invests $2 million at a priced round with a valuation of $8M pre-money/$10M post money.  Assuming the company has 2M outstanding shares at the time of the financing, the price per share will be 8M (valuation) / 2M (shares) or $4.  The investor will receive 500,000 shares:

|  | Starting ownership (shares) | Starting ownership (%) | New shares | Ownership after Investment (shares) | Ownership after Investment (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 50%  |  | 1,000,000 | 40%  |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 50% |  | 1,000,000 | 40%  |
| Seed Investor |  |  | 500,000 | 500,000 | 20%  |
|  | 2,000,000 | 100% |  | 2,500,000 | 100% |

Now imagine that a year has passed by, the company has limped along and needs additional capital. A new investor agrees to invest an additional $2M *at the same valuation as before.*  

|  | Ownership before  Investment (shares) | Ownership before Investment (%) | New shares | Ownership after Investment (shares) | Ownership after Investment (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 40%  |  | 1,000,000 | 33.33%  |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 40%  |  | 1,000,000 | 33.33%  |
| Seed Investor | 500,000 | 20%  |  | 500,000 | 16.67%  |
| Seed Investor 2 |  |  | 500,000 | 500,000 | 16.67% |
|  | 2,500,000 | 100% |  | 3,000,000 | 100% |

The new investor has now bought 500,000 shares, or 16.67%, and diluted all the existing shareholders equally by 16.67%.  The new valuation of the company is now 3M shares * $4 per share or $12M post money.  

## Safe Dilution Across Multiple Rounds

Now Imagine the same scenario takes place but using the SAFE instrument. The first VC will invests $2 million with a post-money SAFE and a $10M cap. Then, a year later, the second VC will also invests $2 million with a post-money SAFE and a $10M cap.  When these rounds convert, each investor will get 20% and the difference in the dilution will be borne by the founders and existing shareholders

Note: When YC first introduced the SAFE agreement in 2013, it followed a pre-money capitalization. This essentially mimicked a priced round where the pre-money valuation or share price was agreed upon, and additional investments diluted all shareholders equally. In 2018, YC introduced the post-money SAFE, where the investor's ownership is determined regardless of other investments. Since then, most financing has shifted to using the post-money SAFE where investment dilute existing shareholders but not other investors.

## The Effect of the Option Pool

Comparing the two tables above, it appears that a priced round would be superior to a SAFE from a founder equity standpoint.  However, most priced rounds will include an option pool requirementâ€”while SAFE agreements typically do not mention option pools.  The option pool will dilute the founder further, and, depending on how large, can more than make up for the difference in dilution between multiple SAFE rounds  and multiple priced rounds. 

## Control

Beyond ownership, a SAFE is better for the founder for three ways 

1.  Simpler / less onerous (you won't negotiateÂ  founder vesting/option pool/etc). 
2.  More control (you can sell the company withoutÂ needing any shareholder consent) 
3.  better dilution in the eventÂ a cofounder drops out before the next roundÂ (Basically their shares will go back to you / existing shareholdersÂ but not to the safe holders, while if you raise a priced round then a founder drops out their shares "go back" to everyoneÂ pro-ratedly).

## Your Lawyers

Your counsel will always want you to raise via a priced round because it allows them to iterate on complex documents and charge substantially more legal fees than via a Safe.  .Â  

## Conclusion

Safes and Priced Rounds are really 6 one way half dozen the other.  These days most early stage investors are comfortbale with a SAFE, while multi-stage funds sometimes prefer the control and share representation that a priced round provides.  Either is fine. Whatâ€™s more important for a founder is having the right investors around the table
