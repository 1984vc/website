## Understanding Side Letters in SAFEs

When investors contribute larger sums, they often request a side letter. While this practice is generally acceptable, not all terms benefit or treat founders fairly. If a founder agrees to a non-standard term, it can have significant consequences in future funding rounds.

While SAFE side letters are acceptable, we strongly advise founders against accepting a modified SAFE (despite what your lawyers might suggest). Non-standard SAFEs open the door for back-and-forth legal wrangling that strips away the *Simple* from SAFE. Moreover, future investors will likely want to use the same SAFE structure.

## Acceptable Terms for Safe Side Letters at the Seed

- Pro Rata Rights: Allowing large investors to maintain their ownership percentage in the next financing round.  Pro rata rights are a fairly common ask for investors writing $500K+ at the seed.  Make sure the rights are limited to only the next financing round though.  We recommend using the standard language from YC’s pro rata rights letter.
- Information Rights: typically addresses financials and quarterly updates. this is a particularly common ask from multi-stage investors for regular updates and financial reports. Try to not sign up for something you don’t actually do—i.e. monthly financials, or audited financial statements if you’re not yet working with an auditor.
- Board Seats Observer Rights: Granting a board seat observer to a significant investor can be acceptable, as it allows the team to practice what it’s like to have a real board (which will happen at the series A).
- MFN (Most Favored Nation) ensures that if the company later offers more favorable terms to other investors (i.e. a SAFE with a lower cap), those same terms will be extended to the investor with the MFN clause. It’s best practice to re-price your existing SAFEs if you raise at a lower cap anyway reagrdless of whether you have a side letter or not. You don’t want investors in the cap table who feel duped.  Make sure to have an exception for accelerators so if you decide to apply to YCombinator for example you’re not forced to reprice the SAFE at the very low cap of YC’s investment.  A common clause reads:
- Major Investor Rights: is a right in the Series A docuemnts granting your significant investors special privileges including pro rata rights, information rights, and rights of first refusal on certain transactions.  Your Seed lead will often ask for a clause in the side letter guaranteeing that they will be treated as major investor in the next financing round.

## Terms to Avoid in Safe Side Letters

- Super Pro Rata Rights: These rights allow investors to increase their ownership percentage in future rounds, which can lead to significant dilution for founders. A big no.
- Advisory Shares: Folks asking for it are typically the folks you don’t want to work with.
- Liquidation Preferences Beyond 1x: Anything more than 1x can be very unfavorable to founders, as it prioritizes investor returns over the company's success.
- Guaranteed Returns: Promising a specific return on investment can create undue pressure and misalign investor-founder interests.
- Modifying the company capitalization definition:

## Conclusion

Side letters can be a useful tool in securing investment, but it's crucial to understand which terms are beneficial and which are not. Ask around what’s standard—and push back on your investors if the ask is a non-standard one. They probably know!
