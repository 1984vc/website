A brief description of your project goes here.

## Local Development

### Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or if you're using pnpm:  
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Tailwind CSS Setup:**  
   - The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration is defined in `tailwind.config.js`.  
   - To compile your Tailwind styles, run:  
     ```bash
     bash scripts/tailwind.sh
     ```
   - This script processes your Tailwind configuration and outputs the compiled CSS to the appropriate directory.

3. **Build Process:**  
   - Build the project using the build script:  
     ```bash
     bash scripts/build.sh
     ```

4. **Development Server:**  
   - To run a local development server (if applicable), use the provided serve script:  
     ```bash
     bash scripts/serve.sh
     ```
   - This allows you to preview your changes locally as you develop.

## Deployment Process

The project uses GitHub Actions to automate deployments and maintain up-to-date environments.

### Production Deployment

- **Workflow:**  
  Production deployments are handled by the workflow defined in [`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yaml).
  
- **Trigger:**  
  This workflow is triggered upon merging changes to the main branch. It builds, tests, and deploys the project automatically.

### Preview Deployments

- **Workflow:**  
  Preview deployments are managed by [`.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yaml`](.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yaml).
  
- **Purpose:**  
  This workflow is designed to create a staging environment for feature branches and pull requests. This allows you to inspect changes before they are merged into production.

### Automated Updates & Pull Requests

- **Workflow:**  
  Automated updates are handled by [`.github/workflows/pull-latest-and-pr.yaml`](.github/workflows/pull-latest-and-pr.yaml).

- **Function:**  
  This workflow periodically pulls the latest changes from the repository and creates or updates pull requests to ensure that the codebase stays current.

## Tailwind & Build Integration

- The Tailwind CSS build process is integrated into both local development and deployment workflows.
- Ensure that any changes in the Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) are reflected by running the Tailwind build script.
- Both the deployment and local build scripts leverage the Tailwind setup to ensure consistent styling across environments.

---

## Additional Information

- Verify that all environment variables and configurations required by the build and deployment processes are correctly set.
- For any customizations or troubleshooting, refer to the individual scripts in the `scripts/` directory and the GitHub Action workflow files located in `.github/workflows/`.

Happy coding!
