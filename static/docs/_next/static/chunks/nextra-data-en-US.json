It's unintuitive, highly recursive, and has little parallel in traditional finance training. Fortunately, it's easy to learn. And founders who master their cap tables gain an unfair advantage in negotiations. Our goal from this guide is to equip founders with the tools and knowledge to master their cap table and outperform their counterparts in any financing negotiation.The cap table has exactly 100 points—no more, no less. When new shares are granted to employees or investors, the resulting ownership must come from elsewhere in the cap table. That's why while first time founders focus on valuation, more experienced founders care about ownership. To bring this point home, most of the examples in this guide use percentage points to help founders understand the tradeoffs.","raising-your-seed-round#Raising your seed round":"Let's start with a simple example. Two founders start a company, granting themselves 1M shares each and splitting the cap table 50/50. Following, A VC investor would like to buy 20% of the company. The founders and investors agree on a $2 million investment at a valuation of $8M pre-money, $10M post-money.\nPre-money and Post-money describe the valuation of a company at two different points in time: before and after the financing round. A company valued at X before the investment and receiving Y in investment will have a pre-money valuation of X and a post money valuation of (X + Y).\nNow for this example let's assume a priced round which is more straightforward to model than a SAFE. The mechanics for issuing a priced round works as follows:\nFirst, we calculate the Pre-money capitalization, which is the number of shares in the business before the round takes place. In this case it's the 2M shares held by the founders.\nNext, we calculate the Price Per Share, which is equal to the pre-money valuation (what the company is worth before the investment) divided by Pre-money Capitalization. In this case the PPS will be 8,000,000 (dollars) / 2,000,000 (shares)= $4\nLast we calculate the number of new shares being issued to the investor based on their purchase price. In this case the investor is investing $2M into the company at a price per share of $4 resulting in $2,000,000/$4 = 500,000 new shares.\nThe Price Per Share (PPS) in a round can be calculated as the pre-money valuation divided by number of shares (often called Company Capitalization).\nThis investment will result in the following a cap table.\n\tStarting ownership (shares)\tStarting ownership (%)\tNew Shares\tOwnership after Investment (shares)\tOwnership after Investment (%)\tFounder A\t1,000,000\t50%\t\t1,000,000\t40%\tFounder B\t1,000,000\t50%\t\t1,000,000\t40%\tSeed Investor\t\t\t500,000\t500,000\t20%\t\t2,000,000\t100%\t\t2,500,000\t100%\t\nLink to Cap TableNow the post-money valuation is simply the pre-money plus the investment amount = $2M + $8M = $10M. A more accurate post-money definition is the final number of shares, called fully diluted shares or FDS, multiplied by the PPS, which in this case comes out 2.5M shares * $4 = $10M.The new investment dilutes the existing ownership for each founder from by 20% from 50% starting ownership to 40% after.\nIn cap table lexicon, Dilution is the percentage reduction in ownership from a round. It is calculated as the number of new shares being issued from the transaction divided by the fully diluted shares after the transaction. So, in this case, 500,000/2,500,000=20%, A founder who starts at 50% will experiences a 20% dilution will end up with 50% * 0.8 = 40%.\nNow depending on whether the round was a SAFE or a priced round the shares will be issued immediately or promised in the future, but the effect is largely the same with a few differences that we will discuss in the next chapter.","option-pool#Option Pool":"To understand why option pools exist, it is helpful to first show what happens without an option pool. After the investment, the founders identify their first engineer and decide to offer them 5% ownership. Assuming there's no pool, the company asks the board to issue 131,578 new shares to the employee or 5% of the total shares. Once granted, the new shares would dilute everyone's ownership equally.\n\tOwnership after Investment (shares)\tOwnership after Investment (%)\tNew employee shares\tOwnership after employee joins (shares)\tOwnership after employee joins (%)\tFounder A\t1,000,000\t40%\t\t1,000,000\t38.00%\tFounder B\t1,000,000\t40%\t\t1,000,000\t38.00%\tSeed Investor\t500,000\t20%\t\t500,000\t19.00%\tEmployee\t\t\t131,578\t131,578\t5.00%\t\t2,500,000\t100%\t\t2,631,578\t100%\t\nNow the investors' ownership has been diluted from 20% to 19%. However, investors do not expect to be diluted with each new employee hire. To address this, investors in a priced round typically request a reserved option pool—often around 10%—as part of the round. When new employees join, their shares are allocated from this option pool, avoiding further dilution of the investors' stake (and avoiding the hassle of issuing new set of shares). So assuming the investors demand an option pool in the round, the ownership structure becomes 20% for the investor, 10% for the reserved option pool, and 35% for each founder.\n\tStarting ownership (shares)\tStarting ownership (%)\tNew Shares\tOwnership after Seed Investment (shares)\tOwnership after Seed Investment (%)\tFounder A\t1,000,000\t50%\t\t1,000,000\t35%\tFounder B\t1,000,000\t50%\t\t1,000,000\t35%\tSeed Investor\t\t\t571,428\t571,426\t20%\tOption Pool\t\t\t285,714\t285,714\t10%\tEmployee\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t100%\t\t2,857,142\t100%\t\nLink to Cap TableFollowing, in order to grant 5% to the new employee, these shares are moved from the option pool to the employee as opposed to getting issued. The other shareholder's ownership would thus remain at 20%.\n\tOwnership after Seed Investment (shares)\tOwnership after Seed Investment (%)\tEmployee Grant\tOwnership after employee grant (shares)\tOwnership after employee grant (%)\tFounder A\t1,000,000\t35%\t\t1,000,000\t35%\tFounder B\t1,000,000\t35%\t\t1,000,000\t35%\tSeed Investor\t571,428\t20%\t\t571,428\t20%\tOption Pool\t285,714\t10%\t(142,857)\t142,857\t5%\tEmployee\t\t\t142,857\t142,857\t5%\t\t2,857,142\t100%\t\t2,857,142\t100%\t\nFounders often mistakenly assume that the new employee shares are granted at the time of the offer letter. But they're actually not granted until much later because these shares require board approval, which typically occurs during the first board meeting after the employee joins the company. This delay can impact the price of the shares or options being granted.\nNote that if the company is acquired before exhausting all unissued options, these options are effectively wiped off and everyone's ownership increases by 5%Until the mid-2000s, priced rounds like the example above were the primary way founders raised capital. Then came convertible notes, and then came SAFEs.The Usual Disclaimer The information in this User Guide is provided solely for general educational purposes and is not intended as legal advice.

Historically, startups received initial funding through the Series A equity rounds. As the venture capital industry grew and startup costs decreased in the mid-2000s, the Seed ecosystem emerged with smaller rounds and a focus on speed. Seed investors initially used Convertible Notes, which were quicker to issue than equity.  But because Convertibles are fundamentally a debt instrument, they had many drawbacks: Convertible have an expiration dates requiring repayment or renegotiation, they accrue interest, and it is very hard for founders or note holders to understand their exact ownership because a note's conversion takes place on a pre-money basis. Fundamentally, Convertibles were debt instrument with the conversion being an afterthought, while all investors cared about was the future Conversion to equity.","introducing-safes#Introducing SAFEs":"In response, Y Combinator introduced the first SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) instrument in 2013 as a \"best of both worlds\" solution. A SAFE is neither debt nor equity, but rather a promise of future equity. It is a simple instrument with only two negotiated terms: the Conversion Cap and the Discount (and today only the Conversion Cap). SAFEs don't expire or accrue interest alleviating a lot of headaches for founders, and they give their holders a number of rights that more closely resemble those of a shareholder—for example, the original SAFE included pro-rata rights for investors.  Like a good product finding Product Market Fit, SAFEs became wildly successful. However, the conversion mechanics of the initial SAFE operated on a pre-money as opposed to a post-money basis, so the confusion around ownership persisted.Following, YC introduced the post-money SAFE in 2018. This new instrument had several improvements over the original 2013 version, granting investors more equity-like rights in M&A events, removing pro-rate by default, and offering a more streamlined investment payout. The most significant change, however, was the shift from pre-money conversion to post-money conversion.A SAFE can be downloaded from YC's website (the current version for a \"Valuation Cap, no Discount\", the most common form of SAFE, is 1.2)","high-level-terms-of-the-safe#High level terms of the SAFE":"Today the vast majority of early stage investment takes place via a Post-Money SAFE instrument.  The high level terms:\nPromise of future equity: Investors receive the right to future shares in the company, rather than immediate equity or debt.\nConversion at a Post-money valuation: The Valuation described in the SAFE is what the investment will convert to in the next financing round (irrespective of how many other SAFEs are issued). That ownership will still get diluted by the financing round itself and by any increase to the Option Pool.\nAutomatic Conversion: investors do not have a choice about converting in an equity financing round; a safe is intended to turn safe holders into stockholders.\nOption Pool: As the SAFE instrument evolved, so did the definition of what constitutes an Option Pool. In today's SAFE (1.2),  Post-Money Valuation Cap is \"post\" the Options and option pool existing prior to the Equity Financing, but not \"post\" the new or increased option pool adopted as part of the Equity Financing (e.g. Series A).\nNo concept of a \"round\": A SAFE instrument is an agreement between an investor and the company, and doesn't require a minimum or maximum round size to take effect. This provides founders with tremendous flexibility during fund raising: they can stack SAFEs, increase valuation over time, etc.\nLiquidity in an M&A:  The safe functions like standard non-participating preferred stock in an M&A (or on a dissolution) so it is junior to debt (including any outstanding notes) and on par with payments to shareholders and other SAFE holders\nNo interest or maturity date: Unlike convertible notes, SAFEs don't accrue interest or have an expiration date.\nFor a more detailed review of the SAFE document, we recommend YC's Quick Start Guide","mechanics-of-safe-conversion#Mechanics of SAFE Conversion":"The mechanics of converting SAFE into shares as part of a priced round are pretty similar to a traditional round:\nFirst we calculate the Pre-money capitalization for the priced round (which is all shares Issued and Outstanding + Unissued Options + Shares from converting securities including SAFEs)\nNext we calculate the Price Per Share  for both the SAFE (based on its cap) and the priced Round. A Post-money Safe with a Cap will convert at the lower PPS of the two (i.e if the round's pre-money is lower than the Safe Cap then the SAFE will convert at the round's PPS)\nLast, we issue new shares for the SAFE holders and the price round investors.\nStraightforward. But there's a wrinkle: to calculate the Pre-money capitalization of the round we need to know the number of shares issued from converting the SAFE.  But the number of shares issued from converting the SAFE depends on the pre-money capitalization. Herein lies our first Recursive calculation for cap tables (And why we put together a model so you don't have to construct circular references in Excel) .If you're curious, here's how the math works. Let's go back to our example where an investor has invested $2M on a Post-money SAFE with a cap of $10M.  Next, founders agree with the Series A lead on an $8M investment at a $32M pre / $40M post money valuation. In theory, the new investor would buy enough new shares to own at least 20% of the cap table (2/10)\n\tStarting ownership (shares)\tStarting ownership (%)\tFirst Safe Round\tFounder A\t1,000,000\t50%\t\tFounder B\t1,000,000\t50%\t\tSeed Investor 1\t\t\tThe right to buy at least 2/(8+2) = 20% of equity\t\t2,000,000\t100%\t\t\nThe SAFE investor will own 20% of the company before the priced round transaction.  To calculate their shares, we need to calculate the PPS for the Safe Conversion,  the PPS for the priced round, and use the lower number.  But first we need The Company Capitalization.Company Capitalization is equal to Capital Stock Issued and Outstanding + Unissued Options + Converting Securities from the SAFE.  And because the investor will own at least 20% of the company, we can rewrite Company Capitalization as:Company Capitalization = Capital Stock Issued and Outstanding + Unissued Options +  (0.2 * Company Capitalization)\nTherefore\nCompany Capitalization = 2,000,000 shares + 0 + (0.2 * Company Capitalization)\nTherefore Company Capitalization before the priced round  = 2,000,000 / (1-0.2) = 2,500,000\nPPS for SAFE conversion is 10,000,000 / 2,500,000 = $4\nPPS for priced round = pre money for the prices round / company capitalization = 32,000,000 / 2,500,000 = $12.8\nShares for Seed Investor  = $2,000,000 / $4  = 500,000 shares\nShares for Series A Investor = $8,000,000 / $12.8 = 625,000 shares\n\tStarting ownership (shares)\tStarting ownership (%)\tSafe Round\tShares in Priced Round\tFDS Shares\tFDS %\tFounder A\t1,000,000\t50%\t\t\t1,000,000\t32%\tFounder B\t1,000,000\t50%\t\t\t1,000,000\t32%\tSeed Investor\t\t\tThe right to buy at least 2/(8+2) = 20% of equity\t500,000\t500,000\t16%\tSeries A Investor\t\t\t\t625,000\t625,000\t20%\t\t2,000,000\t100%\t\t\t3,125,000\t\t\nLink to Cap Table Et voila. The series A owns 20%. The safe investors originally owned 20% and were then diluted by the Series A's 20% resulting in a 16% ownership. And the overall dilution to the founders are 36% (20%+16%, or 1,125,000/3,125,000)Now of course things aren't that simple.  The Series A investor will also demand that the company allocates a new option pool for new hires, which will add more recursive iterations into the calculation. We won't go into all the Math here, but you can see the resulting cap table here.Suggested Reading: Safe Side Letters"}},"/founders-handbook/founder-departure":{"title":"Founder Departure","data":{"":"Founder departure is inevitable.  And the more founders a startup has, the more likely one will depart early in the life of the company.

Although technically the founder hasn't vested any shares (most early grants have a one year cliff), the founders agree that the departing founder will get to keep 200,000 shares in return for signing a clean separation agreement.  The remaining shares will revert to the company's ownership, essentially \"disappearing\" from the denominator and boosting each shareholder's equity. The new total outstanding shares in the company is reduced by the forfeited 800,000 shares resulting in 1.6M fully diluted shares.\n\tStarting Ownership (shares)\tStarting Ownership (%)\tFounder departure (shares buyback)\tOwnership after departure (shares)\tOwnership after departure (%)\tFounder A\t1,000,000\t40%\t\t1,000,000\t58.82%\tFounder B\t1,000,000\t40%\t(800,000)\t200,000\t11.76%\tSeed Investor\t500,000\t20%\t\t500,000\t29.41%\t\t2,500,000\t100%\t\t1,700,000\t100%\t\nNote that, in the example above, both Founder A and the Seed Investor's ownership  was boosted by roughly 47% (800,000/1,700,000)Now, imagine that the initial round was done via a SAFE as opposed to a via a priced round. In this instance the investors actually get the right to own 20% of the company at the future financing. But they don't actually get issues any shares.

But there are strategies that founders can use to lower that dilutionUltimately, the best defense against dilution is execution: the better the company performs, the higher its valuation, and the more cards a founder has during the negotiation. But beyond executing your way to high valuations, here are a few other ideas:","1-get-a-second-term-sheet#1. Get a Second Term Sheet":"A second term sheet (or BATNA - Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) is your best negotiation tactic. It provides leverage by showing other investors are interested, It creates competition, and it gives you options if negotiations with the lead investor fall throughTo get a second term sheet while maintaining professionalism:\nCreate urgency by setting a clear timeline for your fundraising process\nWhen speaking with investors, mention you're in advanced discussions without naming specific firms\nFocus on your company's strengths and growth potential rather than other offers\nUse phrases like \"we're seeing strong interest\" or \"we're in late-stage discussions with several firms\"\nRemember, the goal is to generate genuine interest, not to simply shop around an existing offer. Be transparent about your process while maintaining discretion about specific details particularly who the other player are.","2-negotiate-down-the-leads-ownership#2. Negotiate Down the lead's Ownership":"Series A leads often start negotiations with a high ownership targets—around 15% but some as high as 20%. These numbers are always up for negotiation. If the proposed capital is more than you actually need, try to negotiate down the round size (or if you have other investors you want to bring, the lead investor's check size).","3-offer-other-attractive-terms#3. Offer Other Attractive Terms":"Consider conceding on other terms like board structure, information rights, more protective provisions or major investor rights in exchange for lower ownership. But don't give away too much board control or roll the ownership can down the road by offering super pro-rata.  That will come back and bite you.","4-negotiate-a-smaller-option-pool#4. Negotiate a Smaller Option Pool":"Investors often require a company to set aside a significant option pool (10%-12%) for future employees, which dilutes existing shareholders. Negotiating a smaller option pool (say 5-8%) will substantially reduce the dilution from the round. However, expect significant investor push back. And if your executive team is thin, your lead might refuse.","5-re-negotiate-pro-rata-rights-for-early-investors#5. Re-negotiate Pro Rata Rights for Early Investors":"Investors understand that founders can be very sensitive towards dilution particularly if the round starts to balloon.  Often founders can go back to their existing investors during the round and ask them to relinquish part or all their pro-rata rights. The best strategy here is to get your most friendly investor to agree to a reduced pro-rata, then call all the others and let them know that you will reduce pro-rata for all investors equally and that one / your lead has already agreed.","6-negotiate-a-founder-grant#6. Negotiate a Founder Grant":"Another approach is to agree with the lead investor on the option pool but also ask that a small percentage, say 1% or 2%, are granted to the founder post financing. This approach works best if the CEO's ownership has fallen below an acceptable threshold (say 20% at the A or 10% at the B)   making the case for a small uptick. Investors will push back: existing investors will push back at getting diluted relative to founder and new investors, while new investors will push back on having a smaller option pool available for new hires than originally planned.  So tread carefully.Beyond the 6 strategies above, there are strategies founders can deploy well in advance of the round to minimize their dilution including the following :","7-start-with-fewer-co-founders#7. Start with Fewer Co-founders":"A company with three equal co-founders at 33% each can be a real cause for concern.  By the time the company reaches a Series A the CEO could well have less than 20% ownership.  So think thoughtfully about who should should be a co-founder and what ownership they should have.  that It's no secret that first-time founders tend to have multiple co-founders, while more seasoned founders tend to have at most one co-founder and retain the majority of the cap table at founding.","8-limit-pro-rata-rights-for-early-investors#8. Limit Pro Rata Rights for Early Investors":"Seed fund investors typically ask for pro rata rights, but it's advisable to only grant these rights to your larger investors—typically those who have invested $500K or more. This ensures that only significant investors can maintain their ownership percentage, thereby limiting the overall dilution in your next round","9-raise-more-earlier#9. Raise More Earlier":"One way to minimize dilution is to raise a larger Seed round or a follow-on seed extension with small dilution to the founder. By securing more capital during the seed stage, you can delay the need for Series A funding, giving your company more time to grow and potentially achieve a higher valuation, which in turn reduces the dilution percentage when you do raise Series A.","10-build-something-people-want#10. Build Something People Want":"It's a simple fact that's often forgotten: the more you have product-market-fit, the less you sell in any financing round. Some of our best portfolio companies have skipped a round altogether, jumping straight from a Seed to a Series B and skipping all the dilution that takes place in an A.An ending note:Remember, negotiation is a normal part of the fundraising process. With clear communication and a strong value proposition, you can often find a middle ground that works for both parties.Suggested Reading: Structured and Down Rounds"}},"/founders-handbook/pre-money-vs-post-money-conversion":{"title":"Pre-money vs Post-money Conversion","data":{"":"In 2018 YC replaced the original Pre-money safe (where investors and company agree on the pre-money valuation) with the Post-money safe (where investors and company agree on the post-money valuation the safe converts). The key difference between the two conversion methods is around calculating the ownership being sold in an investment:\nIf an investor and company agree on a pre-money valuation, then an investor's ownership is a function of their investment, the pre-money valuation and the size of round (and all other rounds until conversion).\nBut if an investor and company agree on a post-money valuation, then an investor's ownership is a function of their investment and the post-money valuation irrespective of the round size or any other rounds taking place until conversion.\nFor a company raising just one SAFE round, there's effectively no difference: an investor who invests $2M on $8M pre-money is presumably willing to invest $2M on $10M post-money, with the same resulting ownership of 20%. But things are different when multiple SAFE rounds are involved. Let's look at two examples","conversion-on-a-pre-money-basis#Conversion on a Pre-money Basis":"Consider a company that's in the example above.

By this point, seed investors have bought 20% of the company. Several employees have joined and were granted a total of say 7% leaving 3% remaining option pool.Given we have covered SAFE conversion  already, in this example we assume the seed round was a priced one to simplify the calculations and emphasize the points on option pool and prorate. But the effect is the same.Our starting cap table now looks like the following:\n\tOwnership before Series A (shares)\tOwnership before Series A (%)\tFounder A\t1,000,000\t35%\tFounder B\t1,000,000\t35%\tEmployees\t200,000\t7%\tSeed Investor\t571,428\t20%\tAvailable Option Pool\t85,714\t3%\t\t2,857,142\t100%\t\nNext, the founders agree with the Series A lead on an $8M investment at a $40M post money valuation. The new investor will buy enough new shares to own 20% of the cap table which translates to 714,286 shares (PPS is 32,000,000 / 2,857,142 = $11.2) and the investment would only dilute each shareholder by 20% (8/40). So founders ownership would go from 35% to 28% (0.8*35), etc. And the cap table would look as following:\n\tOwnership before Series A (shares)\tOwnership before Series A (%)\tNew Series A Shares\tOwnership after Series A (shares)\tOwnership after Series A (%)\tFounder A\t1,000,000\t35%\t\t1,000,000\t28%\tFounder B\t1,000,000\t35%\t\t1,000,000\t28%\tEmployees\t200,000\t7%\t\t200,000\t5.6%\tSeed Investor\t571,428\t20%\t\t571,428\t16%\tSeries A investor\t\t\t714,286\t714,286\t20%\tAvailable Option Pool\t85,714\t3%\t\t85,714\t2.4%\t\t2,857,142\t100%\t\t3,571,427\t100%\t\nHowever, there are two problems with this cap table.  First, the option pool has now been diluted down to 2.4%, barely enough for the number of new hires needed as part of this cash infusion. Additionally, the existing investors have also been diluted down to 16% but they often have pro-rata rights in the subsequent round. Addressing both problems will increase the dilution to the founders further.","refreshing-the-option-pool#Refreshing the option pool":"Let's start with the option pool. In order to create another 10% option pool, which is very common in a Series A, the company will need to reserve enough shares such that the option pool after getting diluted by the Series A investor will be 10%.

In other words, existing shareholders are taking on more of the dilution.","dealing-with-pro-rata#Dealing with pro rata":"Now if the seed investors also decides to maintain their 20% ownership, they will need to participate in the round.  The company now must issue additional shares to seed investors, the series A investor and allocate more options in the option pool. To address all these needs, the company will end up issuing a total of 1,542,858 new shares resulting in a cap table with 4,400,400 shares.  Seed and A investors will both end up at 20%.

While this practice is common, not all terms are desirable. If a founder agrees to a non-standard term, it can have significant consequences in future funding rounds.  Below are details of the most commonly asked terms.","pro-rata-rights#Pro-rata rights":"Pro rata rights are a fairly common ask for investors writing $500K+ at the seed and allow large investors to maintain their ownership percentage in the next financing round.  We recommend using the standard language from YC's pro rata rights letter.  Specifically:\nMake sure the rights are limited to only the next financing round as opposed to all subsequent financings (perpetual pro-rata).  In a SAFE, the term \"Equity Financing\" is defined as the next equity financing.  If using alongside other instruments, make sure this point is explicit.\nTry to use the standard formula (investors will buy shares in this round equal equal to the ratio from converting all shares of the investor's safe divided by the company capitalization) as opposed to a hard ownership target (i.e. investor will have the right to buy enough shares to maintain X%\")\n\"The Investor shall have the right to purchase its pro rata share of Standard Preferred Stock being sold in the Equity Financing (the \"Pro Rata Right\").  Pro rata share for purposes of this Pro Rata Right is the ratio of (x) the number of shares of Capital Stock issued from the conversion of all of the Investor's Safes with a \"Post-Money Valuation Cap\" to (y) the Company Capitalization.\"","most-favored-nationmfn#Most Favored Nation(MFN)":"Another common ask is an MFN which ensures that, if the company offers more favorable terms to a new investor after executing this safe, these same terms will be extended to the investor.  Because \"favorable\" isn't a well-defined term, an MFN clause can take many levels of complexity\nThe simplest MFN simply explains the right:\nMFN Rights: In the event that the Company issues any additional Simple Agreement for Future Equity, or convertible notes, at any time when the Investor holds the SAFE, which have terms that are more favorable to the holders thereof than the terms of the SAFE, such as a larger conversion discount, lower cap, or triggers for forced conversion, the Company shall promptly provide substantially equivalent rights to the Investor without further consideration.\nIt's also advantageous to the company to explicitly layout a mechanism for communicating the clause to the investor and putting the oneous on the investor to determine whether or not the terms are more favorable.  YC's standard MFN clause reads:\n\"MFN\" Amendment Provision: If the Company issues any Subsequent Convertible Securities with terms more favorable than those of this Safe (including, without limitation, a valuation cap and/or discount) prior to termination of this Safe, the Company will promptly provide the Investor with written notice thereof, together with a copy of such Subsequent Convertible Securities (the \"MFN Notice\") and, upon written request of the Investor, any additional information related to such Subsequent Convertible Securities as may be reasonably requested by the Investor.  In the event the Investor determines that the terms of the Subsequent Convertible Securities are preferable to the terms of this instrument, the Investor will notify the Company in writing within 10 days of the receipt of the MFN Notice. Promptly after receipt of such written notice from the Investor, the Company agrees to amend and restate this instrument to be identical to the instrument(s) evidencing the Subsequent Convertible Securities.\nLast, if the SAFE is being executed very early in the life  of the company and the company might consider applying to an accelerator like YC itself, it is recommended to  have an exception for accelerators—so you're not forced to reprice the SAFE at the cap of YC's investment.  This typically reads\n… For purposes of this paragraph, \"Subsequent Convertible Securities\" excludes any Safes issued to Y Combinator or its affiliates, including but not limited to Y Combinator ES20, LLC and YC ESP22, L.\nNote: even if your investors don't have an MFN and your raise a subsequent round at a lower cap,  it's best practice to re-price your existing SAFEs. As a general rule, you don't want investors in the cap table who feel duped","major-investor-rights#Major Investor Rights":"Seed investors often ask for the right to be named a \"Major Investor\" in the next financing round. \"Major Investor Rights\" will show up in the priced round / Series A documents granting the largest investors a set of additional rights including Pro rata rights, Information rights, and rights of first refusal on certain transactions.  The downside from promising seed investors Major Investor Status is that more of your investors will have pro-rata rights in the Series B (the round following the next financing round).  But that is often open to renegotiating.  Typically the largest 1-2 investors in the round are granted this right.\nMajor Investor Status The Company agrees that, upon the issuance of Safe Preferred Stock by the Company to the Investor in the Equity Financing pursuant to the Safe, the Investor shall be entitled to receive the same information rights and pro rata rights (for securities issuances occurring after the Equity Financing) that are provided to \"Major Investors\" (or such similar term) in such Equity Financing; provided that the Investor shall be subject to all of the same terms, conditions and restrictions as applicable to other Major Investors.","board-observer-seat-rights#Board Observer Seat Rights":"Some investors, particularly multi-stage funds that are used to taking board seats, ask for board observer rights when signing a SAFE. Some founders chose to decline the request to avoid the hassle of running a board so early on in the life of the company, while others are more open to it—and it allows the team to practice what it's like to have a real board (which will happen at the series A). Our recommendation: a board observer seat is an ok give so long as the founder is comfortable with the level of investor involvement an observer seat signals.","qsbs-matters#QSBS Matters":"Investors might ask a company to ensure it remains qualified as a \"qualified small business stock\" (QSBS) because of the significant tax benefits associated with this status. Investors in QSBS can potentially exclude up to 100% of their capital gains from federal taxes when they sell their shares, subject to certain conditions and limits. This is one where the interest of the investor and of the founders are very much aligned as founders also want their to qualify as QSBSTo maintain QSBS status, companies typically need to meet certain criteria, such as being a C-corporation, having gross assets under $50 million at the time of stock issuance, and engaging in qualified trades or businesses. That said, certain types of share buy backs can disqualify a company from QSBS stock.  Founders subject to personal US taxations should make sure to become familiarize with QSBS  This clause typically reads something like:\nQSBS Matters: The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares issued upon conversion of the Safes, as well as any shares into which such Safes are converted, within the meaning of Section 1202(f) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), to constitute \"qualified small business stock.\" The Company will submit to its stockholders (including the Investor) and to the Internal Revenue Service any reports that may be required under Section 1202(d)(1)(C) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.","managementinspectioninformation-rights#Management/Inspection/Information Rights":"This is a particularly common ask from investors accustomed to taking board seats.  It takes differnt forms\nProviding the Investor with information rights  — regular financial records, business prospects,  corporate affairs of the Company, etc\nEntitling the investor to consult with and advise management of the Company on significant business issues\nWhat matters most here: Try to not sign up for something you don't want to do—i.e. monthly financials or audited financial statements if you're not yet working with an auditor.  And make sure the investor's expectation on their involvement with the company lines up with yours.","terms-to-avoid-in-safe-side-letters#Terms to Avoid in Safe Side Letters":"Super Pro Rata Rights: These rights allow investors to increase their ownership percentage in future rounds, which can lead to significant dilution for founders. A big no.\nAdvisory Shares: Folks asking for additional shares on the side are typically the folks you don't want to work with.\nLiquidation Preferences Beyond 1x: Anything more than 1x can be very unfavorable to founders, as it prioritizes investor returns over the company's success (More in Stuctured and Downrounds)\nGuaranteed Returns: Promising a specific return on investment can create undue pressure and misalign investor-founder interests.\n📢 Important Note: While SAFE side letters are standard practice, founders should be very wary of  accepting a modified SAFE that deviates from the standard form (despite what your lawyers might suggest). Non-standard SAFEs open the door for back-and-forth legal wrangling that strips away the Simple from SAFE—and modifying some clauses, particularly changes to Company Capitalization, can be very detrimental to founders. Moreover, future investors who ask to see the SAFE will ask to use the same modified version.","conclusion#Conclusion":"Side letters can be a useful tool in securing investment, but it's crucial to understand which terms are beneficial and which are not.

This is partly because priced rounds require more legal work, but the most commonly cited reason is that priced rounds are better for dilution. However, a closer examination reveals this isn't always the case.\nWhile a priced round's pre-money conversion is generally more favorable to founders than a SAFE's post-money conversion, the difference in dilution between these two methods extends beyond this simple comparison. It depends on several factors that founders can't predict in advance:\nThe number of SAFE rounds raised\nThe size of the option pool demanded by Series Seed investors compared to Series A investors, and the number of options granted between rounds\nPotential founder departures before the next priced round\nThe possibility of an M&A event\nLet's examine these factors in more detail.","priced-round-dilution-across-multiple-rounds#Priced Round Dilution Across Multiple Rounds":"Imagine A VC invests $2M at a priced round with a valuation of $8M pre-money/$10M post money.

Secondaries allow founders and early employees to realize some personal financial gain without waiting for an IPO or acquisition. It has become more common in recent years as times to exits have gotten longer.Unlike a primary issuance of stock, secondaries are not dilutive to existing shareholders (since the transaction is simply existing shares trading hands). The buyer is typically buying common shares which do not have a liquidation preference associated with them. As a result, secondaries often trade at a discount to primary preferred stock.  To sell secondaries a founder needs to wait till the right time then (A) find a buyer, and (B) get the consent of the board","when-to-sell-secondaries#When to Sell Secondaries":"Secondaries typically occur during later-stage rounds, usually starting at Series C or beyond. For top-performing companies, secondaries can take place as early as Series B. There are also rare cases of secondaries occurring earlier : During the heyday of 2020, for example, A16Z famously bought $2M of secondaries as part of its $10M round to win the Clubhouse Series A sweepstakes. However, in today's market, that would be a tough act for a founder to pull off.While most secondaries occur as part of a financing round, One-off Secondary sales do occur particularly if a founder is exiting the company\n💡 The best time to sell secondaries is once the company approaches a valuation between $500M-$1B and has a round that is clearly oversubscribed.","finding-a-buyer#Finding a buyer":"The ideal buyer is an existing investor looking to increase their ownership. They are already familiar with the business, and their willingness to buy secondaries sends a positive signal to others who might be contemplating buysing secondaries as well.\nThe lead investor of the new funding round is also a potential buyer, though it's a more challenging conversation if the round isn't highly competitive.\nOver the past few years, a number of secondaries-only funds have popped up that have both the expertise and the dedicated capital for secondaries (Industry Ventures, Truebridge Capital, etc)\nFamily offices, institutions and other limited partners of venture capital funds can also be buyers of secondaries—particularly once the company has become a recognizable brand name. LPs naturally are most familiar with companies in their fund's portfolio, so your existing investors are the best source of introduction to those LPs.\nFor later stage/pre-IPO companies, Investment Banks can be buyers","getting-investor-consent#Getting investor consent":"Most companies will have a Rights of First Refusal on founder stock sale and also a co-sale agreement allowing investors to sell a portion of their shares alongside the founders. So getting your lead investor / board member buy-in is a must.\nInvestors understand that providing founders with some liquidity will help alleviate undue stress and aligns incentives by removing the allure of a mediocre M&A event. At the same time, founders react differently to the newly found wealth.  Selling large amount or selling at an earlier round (Series A or B) will be a red flag.\nAlthough a secondary round doesn't dilute existing investors' ownership, they may still oppose capital going to management instead of strengthening the company's balance sheet—especially in a tight fundraising climate. Because of all the above, waiting until the appropriate time to broach the topic with your board.\n💡 Hold off on discussing secondaries with investors until the funding round is clearly oversubscribed. Broaching the subject when the round is undersubscribed or barely coming together will backfire. To shareholders, a company's capital needs trump a founder's desire to cash out.","how-much-can-i-sell#How much Can I Sell?":"There are no hard and fast rules. Secondaries are typically in the millions, although a $500K secondary sale is not uncommon.Investor's reception to secondaries will be a function of both how well the company is doing, and how much a founder is selling relative to their needs. If you're selling a few percentage points to buy your first home for your young family, your investors will be supportive. If you're selling 20% and are eyeing your next vacation home or yacht summer vacation in the med, they will push back. Make a compelling case to your board for why the cash will help you devote more time and mental energy to the business.\n💡 Today most investors will support a secondary sale for 5-10% of the founder's stake at an oversubscribed Series C.","price-of-secondaries#Price of Secondaries":"The price of secondaries is typically at a discount compared to primary shares, reflecting their common stock status and lack of liquidation preference. However, the discount varies significantly based on the company's performance:\nFor top-performing companies in a clearly oversubscribed round, the discount is often negligible, with secondaries trading close to or at the price of preferred shares.\nFor decently performing companies with some investor appetite, secondaries trade at a 10-30% discount to primary shares.\nFor an average company, the discount can be substantial, potentially reaching as low as 50% or more of the primary share price. And finding a buyer will be a challenge.\nAs companies approach an IPO or other liquidity event, the discount on secondaries tends to narrow.","things-to-watch-out-for#Things to watch out for":"Tender Offer: Depending on the number of sellers and other factors, the transaction may need to be structured according to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation 14E (e.g., offer kept open for 20 business days)\n409A: Secondary sales can impact 409A valuations for common shares or options held by employees by providing a data point for the fair market value of common stock. However, the impact may be limited if the secondary sale price is significantly discounted compared to the preferred stock price or if the transaction volume is small.\nShareholder count.  Secondaries increases the number of shareholders on the cap table. For larger private companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) typically imposes a 2,000 shareholder limit to avoid public reporting.\nQSBS: Qualified Small Business Stock status offers significant tax benefits to both founders and investors, allowing them to potentially exclude up to 100% of their capital gains from federal taxes when they sell their shares. By definition a secondary transaction does not qualify for QSBD. But if it triggers a \"Significant stock redemptions\" it can disqualify a company from maintaining its QSBS status for all existing shareholders. So any attempt to convert founders share from common to preferred through stock redemption should be considered very carefully by your counsel.\nEmployee Morale: news of Secondaries can impact perception and morale for employees. The best practice here is to initially keep it under wraps and, when the time is right, open the secondary sale to other early employee of the company as well (i.e. every employee who has been there for more than 4 years can sell up to 10% of their shares, etc).\n💡 Secondary sales are a high-stakes exercise. They require board approval and getting familiarity with many esoteric concepts—from Reg 14E to the impact of redemption rights on QSBS status. Be prepared. And make sure to arm yourself with legal counsel from a top-tier Silicon Valley firm. Their hefty bills are well worth it when the stakes are this high."}},"/founders-handbook/structured-and-downrounds":{"title":"Structured and Down Rounds","data":{"":"A \"structured round\" is a financing round where terms are tailored to offer additional downside protection for investors, often at the expense of founders and existing shareholders. These terms can include features like additional warrants, liquidation preferences, guaranteed returns, and pay-to-play provisions. Structured rounds are typically used in later-stage investments or when a company is perceived as struggling. While nearly absent from the venture capital lexicon for almost a decade, they've returned in full force over the past two years as late-stage companies reel from the heights of 2021.","understanding-your-options#Understanding Your Options":"A company that has raised at a valuation higher than what it can merit today is faced with three options:\nRaise money at the same valuation as before but with dirty terms like a superior liquidation preference or guaranteed return (Structure)\nTake a clean round at a lower valuation (Downround)\nDo all you can to turn profitable\n📢 While downaound can be a hard pill to swallow as a CEO, time and time again we believe a down rounds is better for existing shareholders than a structured round for two reasons: it resets the valuation to a market one and avoids burdening the company with onerous terms, a point first made by Bill Gurley back in 2016 in his article On the Road to Recap.","structured-rounds#Structured Rounds":"Not all Structure is created equal. Here are the most common asks, roughly ranked best to worst.\nTerm\tDescription\tEffect\tWarrants\tInvestors will ask for additional options that convert to common stock, in essence increasing their ownership relative to what they paid at the round price.\tWarrants are the most benign form of structure. It's a way for new investors to effectively get a lower valuation while allowing founders and investors to save face with employees and LPs.\tPay-to-Play\tA clause that incentivizes existing investors participate in the round—or they lose certain preferences or rights, most often the conversion of their preferred shares to common shares.\tWhile loathed by earlier investors, pay to play is actually a company and founder friendly provision: it enables the business to raise more capital, and, in the event investors do not participate, it reduces the overall liquidation stack.\tDividends / PIKs\tStipulate the payment of a dividend on preferred shares (often called PIK for \"paid in kind\" dividend)\tCan get pretty dilutive pretty quickly. Make sure you're on a path to sell the company.\tGuaranteed IPO returns\tEnsures that investors receive a minimum return on their investment when the company goes public, regardless of the IPO price. Typically asked for in pre IPO situations as opposed to distressed situations.\tNot the end of the world—unless the expected IPO price is actually close to the liquidation stack of the company.\tSeries-based M&A vetoes\tProvides the lead investor in this round with the right to veto an M&A.  This is an ask that typically comes from a strategic of some form.\tCase-by-case but generally pretty bad for future M&A\tSAFE with Liquidation Preferences\tInvestors invest at the same post money as the previous round via a safe, but demand a liquidation preference in the form of 1.2-2x (sometimes as high as 3-4x).  This investment saves face but will reduce payouts to existing shareholders in an M&A substantially.\tLiquidation preferences are bad: they will ruin M&A payouts and set a precedent that  future investors are guaranteed to follow.  If you have to accept liquidation preference, you want to accept it via a SAFE with a liquidation preference that goes away on conversion to shares in the next equity financing. If the company turns around and raises an equity round, the liq pref will disappear.\tPriced round  with Liquidation Preferences\tInvestors buy equity in the company via a priced round and institute a liquidation preference for their shares\tThis is pretty bad.  Once an investor in the cap table has liquidation preference, all future investors will have an equal or a higher liquidation preference.  Consider a clean downround instead.","downround#Downround":"A downround is a standard priced round where the PPS is less than the PPS in the previous round. In a downround, existing shareholders who invested at a higher valuation are typically entitled to some compensation (called Anti-dilution provisions). The Anti-dilution are typically found in the Certificate of Incorporation.\n\t\t\tFull Ratchet\tIn a Full Ratchet, the conversion price of the investor's preferred shares is adjusted to the price paid in the downround, regardless of the number of shares issued. This ensures that the investor's ownership percentage remains the same as it was before the downround.\tFull Ratchets are very dilutive for founders and existing shareholders.  Avoid them while you can.\tBroad-Based Weighted Average\tThe conversion price of the preferred shares is adjusted to a weighted average of the price paid in the previous round and the price paid in the downround taking into account all outstanding shares, including preferred and common shares, when calculating the new conversion price.\tThis is a more moderate approach compared to a full ratchet. The effect can be mild, particularly if the downround is much smaller in size than the previous round.\t(This is the most common provision and the recommended one by the NVCA)\tNarrow-Based Weighted Average\tSimilar to a Broad-Based Weighted Average but only considers the preferred shares when calculating the new conversion price, which generally offers less protection to investors than the broad-based method.\t\t\n📢 Although the Anti-dilution rights existing investors are baked into the Certificate of Incorporation, they are often re-negotiated as part of the downround. For example,  if the downround is being led by the same lead of the previous round, the lead might ask to change the anti-dilution provision of their existing shares to Full Ratchet so their entire investment counts at the new valuation. So make sure to understand the difference between all three.","conclusion#Conclusion":"While down rounds can be a tough pill to swallow, they generally create fewer headaches for startups in the long run. They offer a key benefit: raising the next round becomes easier due to a cleaner capital structure. This is an important point: although most founders optimistically hope that a structured or down round will provide them with enough runway to turn the business profitable or secure an exit, this rarely proves to be the case."}}}
