**Raise your pre-seed without** 


Every so often, a company emerges with a talent density that's hard to ignore. Rippling is one of those companies. Staffed with 150 former founders, it is a hotbed for entrepreneurial talent. Its culture - of high ownership, customer centricity and solving unsexy problems - aligns perfectly with our ethos at 1984 Ventures. Accordingly, we are excited to announce the 1984 Ventures **Rippling Founders Program**, a fast-tracked financing program for current and aspiring Rippling founders.


Here's how it works:

1. Complete our 2 minute application. If you don't know what you want to start and just want to brainstorm with us, that's very welcome too!
2. We'll review your application and get back to you within 24 hours. If it's in the 1984 wheelhouse, we'll do a sounding board session with you and get to know you.
3. Depending on the stage of the company, and if it's a mutual fit, we can incubate and/or fund your company with a check ranging from $500,000 to $1,200,000.

### **About** [**1984 Ventures**](http://1984.vc/)


1984 Ventures is a seed firm based in San Francisco. We lead pre-seed and seed rounds in vertical AI, healthcare and open source companies. We've been fortunate to be early investors in companies like [Posthog](https://posthog.com/), [Cline](https://cline.bot/), [BuildOps](https://buildops.com/) and [Tally](https://www.tallyhq.com/) (former Rippling founder).


### **How we help**


We recognize that every company hits stumbling blocks as they get started. That's where we come in. In addition to serving as a trusted advisor and doling out founder therapy when needed (starting a company is hard - even when things are going well!), we also help with hiring and, most importantly, enabling you to raise future rounds of financing from the top VCs in the world.


The best way to capture what founders think of us is to hear directly from them:

> "1984 has the superpower of being my first Whatsapp if everything is going well or badly."

_James Hawkins, CEO of Posthog_

> "1984 stands apart in the VC landscape: unique blend of startup, big tech, and investment firm experience. I value their deep understanding of mid-stage and late-stage dynamics, expertise in cap table management, and commitment to protecting founders from the hidden risks of certain investment terms. You're getting more than just seed investorsâ€”you're getting steadfast allies who truly have your back."

_Brad Porter, former head of Amazon Robotics and founder of Collaborative Robotics_


We're excited to launch this initiative and even more excited to be the first step for Rippling founders who are ready to start their journey towards building an iconic company.
