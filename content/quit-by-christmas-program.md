### **Fundraising hell**


There's never been a more exciting time to start a company. AI is completely transforming how people work. And every sector of the economy is being reshaped, with AI-first companies likely to end up at the helm.


But while starting a company has never been easier, raising your first round of funding hasn't. Maybe you've been quietly building something on nights and weekends but haven't yet quit your job. What would it take to take the plunge? Where would you even go to raise money? Without a warm intro to investors, you're often DOA. Heck, even with a warm intro you're still subjected to endless coffee chats, opaque decision making and ghostings.


The warm intro is an arbitrary gatekeeper of capital. There should be a better way.


### **Introducing the** **Q****u****i****t** **B****y** **C****h****ri****s****t****m****a****s** **Program**


At [1984 Ventures](/), several of our most successful investments came via cold inbound. That's why we're launching the **Quit By Christmas** program. If you've been tinkering on an idea but haven't quit your job yet, apply and get an investment decision in a week. And then quit your job before Christmas :) 


**Our process**


{{< callout type="error" emoji="ðŸ’¡" >}}
Apply **here **(~15 mins). 

You'll hear back from us in 24 hours if we want to interview you. From a first interview, we'll get you an investment decision (on a check of up to $1M) within a week. If we invest, we'll introduce you to other VCs in our network to fill out the rest of your round. 
{{< /callout >}}


### **Who should apply**


If you're thinking about quitting your job but aren't excited about joining an accelerator, we want you to apply.


If you're still at school but have been building something on the side, we want you to apply.


If you're already full-time on an idea, we want you to apply.


### **What do we look for?**


We invest in **exceptional people** solving **hair-on-fire problems** with solutions that are **10x better than the status quo.** You should aim to highlight these elements in your application.

- _What makes someone "exceptional"?_

'Exceptional' can sound subjective and abstract. But in startup land, what we really mean is someone with a clear strength or skillset. Someone can be exceptional at engineering, sales, design, product or marketing. They can be exceptionally intelligent, resilient or charismatic. Strength is more important than well-roundedness or pedigree (although having seen what great looks like increases your odds of business success).

- _What is a hair-on-fire problem?_

A hair-on-fire problem is a burning need that customers are desperate to have solved. You can uncover the intensity of a problem by observing how customers describe it (including how they've already tried to solve it). These problems can also come about when the world changes radically - for example with regulatory changes (e.g. tariffs) or emerging tailwinds (e.g. GLP-1s). 

- _What is a 10x better solution?_

The AI revolution has unlocked radically better ways of doing things. For founders, this means you should be targeting building something that is 10x better than incumbent offerings. You can be 10x better by making customers more money or saving them an order of magnitude of cost. If the efficiency gain is not visceral, you aren't thinking big enough. See [here](https://samit-kalra.com/blog/how-to-find-a-good-startup-idea) for some examples of 10x better solutions.


### **FAQs**

1. _What are the terms of your investment?_

We will invest up to $1M for 6-10% of your company. The exact dollar amount will depend on the company's ask and needs.

1. _Is this an accelerator or incubator?_

No, this is not a batch program for a large number of startups. This is a core investment from our fund where we will work closely with you until you raise your Series A and deliver programming that is tailored to your specific needs.

1. _What sectors do you invest in?_

We predominantly invest in B2B, healthcare and infrastructure/open source startups at the pre-seed and seed stage. Our partners have strong expertise across each of these sectors. Our programming is bespoke to each company.


Our healthcare partner, Farzad Soleimani, is a practicing ER physician and a former healthcare founder. He has strong connectivity into various US hospital systems.


Our infrastructure software partner Mark is an active OSS contributor. He's helped our portfolio companies with content marketing.


Our B2B partners Samit and Ramy have backed over 30 successful B2B AI companies across a range of sectors. Samit has invested across various "AI for services" sectors and Ramy has backed several PLG companies.

1. _What kind of help do you provide post investment?_

Our goal is to work closely with you to achieve product-market-fit and then raise your next, large institutional round of capital. We tend to bucket our help into: **Fundraising**, **Recruiting** and **Founder Therapy**. 


For fundraising, we have a 75% seed-to-Series-A conversion ratio, with our portfolio companies having gone on to raise from Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund, a16z, Index Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Greylock, Accel, Emergence Capital, General Catalyst, Lightspeed and many others.


We frequently help source and vet early hires at our portfolio companies.


And we're on WhatsApp 24/7 with our founders to answer all your ad hoc questions.


We've also written a [**Founder's Handbook**](/docs/founders-handbook/) that contains useful, practical information for founders about topics they may be less versed in (e.g. cap table math, M&A offers, crafting your deck).

1. How much revenue do I need to have when I apply?

We are happy to invest pre-revenue if you are focused on B2B. Our preference is for you to already have an idea and some early customers (including unpaid) so we can better validate the customer need and pain point. 

1. Will you invest outside of the US?

At this point we are nearly exclusively focused on US startups. If you are domiciled elsewhere but selling in the US, we are open to considering your application.


What is the application periuod?


You can apply any time between


Do you invest in solo founders?


We do, if the founder is technical. But we have a preference for teams with co-founders (with at least one technical co-founder)
