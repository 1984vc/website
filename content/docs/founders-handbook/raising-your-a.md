Now letâ€™s take a deeper dive into the mechanics of raising a subsequent round. By this point, several additional employees have joined.  Employees have been granted a total of say 7%  leaving 3% remaining option pool. Our starting cap table now looks like this:

|  | Ownership before Series A (shares) | Ownership before Series A (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 35% |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 35% |
| Seed Investor | 571,428 | 20% |
| Available Option Pool | 85,714 | 3% |
| Employees | 200,000 | 7% |
|  | 2,857,142 | 100% |

Next, the founders agree with the Series A lead on an $8M investment at a $40M post money valuation. In theory, the new investor would buy enough new shares to own 20% of the cap table (which translates to 714,286 shares) and the investment would only dilute each shareholder by 20% (8/40). So founders ownership would go from 35% to 28% (0.8*35), etc. And the cap table would look as following:

|  | Ownership before Series A (shares) | Ownership before Series A (%) | New Series A Shares | Ownership after Series A (shares) | Ownership after Series A (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 35% |  | 1,000,000 | 28% |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 35% |  | 1,000,000 | 28% |
| Seed Investor | 571,428 | 20% |  | 571,428 | 16% |
| Series A investor |  |  | 714,286 | 714,286 | 20% |
| Available Option Pool | 85,714 | 3% |  | 85,714 | 2.40% |
| Employees | 200,000 | 7% |  | 200,000 | 5.60% |
|  | 2,857,142 | 100% |  | 3,571,427 | 100% |

## Refreshing the option pool

Letâ€™s start with the option pool.  In order to accomodate the 10% ask, the company will need to reserve enough shares such that the option pool after getting diluted by the Series A investor will be 10%.  In this case the number is 354,286 new shares.  

|  | Ownership before Series A (shares) | Ownership before Series A (%) | Option pool expansion | New series A shares | Ownership after Series A (shares) | Ownership after Series A (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 35% |  |  | 1,000,000 | 25.26% |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 35% |  |  | 1,000,000 | 25.26% |
| Seed Investor | 571,428 | 20% |  |  | 571,428 | 14.43% |
| Series A investor |  |  |  | 791,837 | 791,837 | 20.00% |
| Available Option Pool | 85,714 | 3% | 354,286 |  | 395,918 | 10.00% |
| Employees | 200,000 | 7% |  |  | 200,000 | 5.05% |
|  | 2,857,142 | 100% |  |  | 3,959,183 | 100.00% |

But in order to maintain the Series A investorâ€™s target ownership of 20%, the number of Series A shares now have to go up from  714,286 shares to 791,837 (the dollar invested will be the same but the price per share will go down), and the resulting cap table will end up with 1,146,123 new shares or a total dilution of ***1,146,123***/***3,959,183 ~ 29%***

<aside>
ðŸ“¢ For those interested in dilution math, how did we get 29% dilution?  Shouldnâ€™t the final dilution just be 20% for the new investor + 7% option pool expansion = 27%? the reason the number is 29% and not 27% is that these new shares must dilute the existing shareholder, and not dilute the Series A investor or the available option pool so they maintain their 20% and 10% respectively.

## Dealing with pro rata

Now if the seed investors needs to maintain their 20% ownership as part of this round, the company will need to issue more shares to the series A investor and issue more shares to the option pool.  The company ends up issuing a total of 1,542,858 new shares resulting in a cap table with 4,400,400 shares.  The founders will get hit by a whopping 35% dilution (1,542,858/4,400,400)

|  | Ownership before Series A (shares) | Ownership before Series A (%) | Option pool expansion | New series A shares  | Ownership after Series A (shares) | Ownership after Series A (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 35% |  |  | 1,000,000 | 22.73% |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 35% |  |  | 1,000,000 | 22.73% |
| Seed Investor | 571,428 | 20% |  | 308,572 | 880,000 | 20% |
| Series A investor |  |  |  | 880,000 | 880,000 | 20% |
| Available Option Pool | 85,714 | 3% | 354,286 |  | 440,000 | 10% |
| Employees | 200,000 | 7% |  |  | 200,000 | 4.55% |
|  | 2,857,142 | 100% |  |  | 4,400,000 | 100% |

It is not uncommon for founders to get hit with 25-30% total dilution in a Series A round.
