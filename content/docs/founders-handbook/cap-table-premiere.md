To most founders, cap table math can be bewildering. It's unintuitive at first and has no parallel in traditional finance training. However, founders who master their cap table math gain an unfair advantage in negotiations. Fortunately, it's easy to learn. Our aim is to equip founders with the tools and knowledge to master their cap table and outperform their counterparts in any financing negotiation.

While many focus on shares, valuation, and round size, experienced founders know that ownership percentage is key. The cap table has exactly 100 points—no more, no less. When new ownership is granted to a founder, employee, or investor, it must come from elsewhere in the cap table. To bring this point home, most of the examples in this guide use percentage points as opposed to share count.  

## Raising your seed round

Let's start with a simple example. Two founders start a company, splitting the cap table 50/50 by granting themselves 1M shares each. A VC invests $2 million at a $10 million valuation for 20% of the company. This investment will result in a cap table that's 40/40/20.  

|  | Starting ownership (shares) | Starting ownership (%) | Ownership after Investment (shares) | Ownership after Investment (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 50%  | 1,000,000 | 40%  |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 50% | 1,000,000 | 40%  |
| Seed Investor |  |  | 500,000 | 20%  |
|  | 2,000,000 | 100% | 2,500,000 | 100% |

The new investment *dilutes* the existing ownership by 20%.  In cap table lexicon, **Dilution** is the percentage reduction in ownership from a round. So a founder who starts at 50% and experiences 20% dilution will end up with 50% * (1 - 20%)  = 40%

(Depending on whether the round was a SAFE or a priced round the shares might be issued immediately or promised in the future, but the effect is largely the same [with a few differences](Safe%20vs%20Priced%20Round%203c5a0edb257449558cf968f5ded58812.md)) 

## Option Pool

After the investment, the founders identify their first engineer and decide to offer them 5% ownership. In this example, the employee will be grated 131,578 shares or 5%, and the new shares would dilute everyone's ownership equally.

|  | Ownership after Investment (shares) | Ownership after Investment (%) | New employee shares | Ownership after employee joins (shares) | Ownership after employee joins (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 40%  |  | 1,000,000 | 38.00% |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 40%  |  | 1,000,000 | 38.00% |
| Seed Investor | 500,000 | 20%  |  | 500,000 | 19.00% |
| Employee |  |  | 131,578 | 131,578 | 5.00% |
|  | 2,500,000 | 100% |  | 2631578 | 100% |

However, because of the new shares, investors have been diluted down from 20% to 19%.  But investors don't want to be diluted every time a new employee joins. To address this, investors typically request an option pool—say 10%—to be reserved as part of the round. As a result, the round's ownership structure becomes 20% for the investor, 35% for each founder, and a 10% reserved option pool. When new employees join, their shares come from this option pool without diluting the investors. 

|  | Starting ownership (shares) | Starting ownership (%) | New Shares | Ownership after Seed Investment (shares) | Ownership after Seed Investment (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 50% |  | 1,000,000 | 35% |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 50% |  | 1,000,000 | 35% |
| Seed Investor |  |  | 571,428 | 571,428 | 20% |
| Option Pool |  |  | 285,714 | 285,714 | 10% |
| Employee |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | 100% |  | 2,857,142 | 100% |

For example, after granting 5% to a new employee, the ownership structure would be 20% investor, 35% each founder, 5% employee, and 5% remaining in the option pool.

|  | Ownership after Seed Investment (shares) | Ownership after Seed Investment (%) | Employee Grant  | Ownership after employee grant (shares) | Ownership after employee grant (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 35% |  | 1,000,000 | 35% |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 35% |  | 1,000,000 | 35% |
| Seed Investor | 571,428 | 20% |  | 571,428 | 20% |
| Option Pool | 285,714 | 10% | (142,857) | 142,857 | 5% |
| Employee |  |  | 142,857 | 142,857 | 5% |
|  | 2,857,142 | 100% |  | 2,857,142 | 100% |

(Note that if the company is acquired before exhausting all unissued options, these options are effectively wiped off and everyone’s ownership increases by 5%)
