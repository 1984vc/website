A "structured round" is a financing round where terms are tailored to offer additional downside protection for investors, often at the expense of founders and existing shareholders. These terms can include features like additional warrants, liquidation preferences, guaranteed returns, and pay-to-play provisions. Structured rounds are typically used in later-stage investments or for companies perceived as struggling. While nearly absent from the venture capital lexicon for almost a decade, they've returned in full force over the past two years as late-stage companies reel from the heights of 2021.

## Anti-Dilution Provisions

Anti-dilution provisions are mechanisms designed to protect existing investors in the event of a downround. There are different types of anti-dilution provisions that investors might have. These are typically found in the Certificate of Incorporation. The 

**1. Full Ratchet:** This provision adjusts the conversion price of the investor's preferred shares to the price paid in the downround, regardless of the number of shares issued. This ensures that the investor's ownership percentage remains the same as it was before the downround.

**2. Weighted Average:** This is a more moderate approach compared to a full ratchet. The conversion price of the preferred shares is adjusted to a weighted average of the price paid in the previous round and the price paid in the downround. There are two types of weighted average provisions: 

- **Broad-Based Weighted Average:** Takes into account all outstanding shares, including preferred and common shares, when calculating the new conversion price. *This is the most common provision and the recommended one by the NVCA*
- **Narrow-Based Weighted Average:** Only considers the preferred shares when calculating the new conversion price, which generally offers less protection to investors than the broad-based method.

## Pay to play

This provision requires existing investors to participate in the downround to benefit from anti-dilution protection. If they do not participate, they may lose certain preferences or rights, such as the conversion of their preferred shares to common shares.

Pay to play is actually a very founder-friendly provision.  It enables the business to raise more capital, and, in the event investors do not participate, their liquidation preferences are removed from the liquidation stack. 

These provisions are typically Understanding these provisions is crucial for both investors and founders as they navigate the complexities of financing rounds and seek to balance interests fairly.

1) SAFE flat to the last round (with a discount to the next round) or priced at the same pps as the last round

2) Flat to the last round plus a kicker in the form of warrants to give investors more equity.  Still no liquidation preferences. Might include a pay to play for existing investors.

3) Flat to the last round plus some warrants and  liquidation preferences (1.5-2x, possibly 3x) .  The key is to make sure the liquidation preferences disappears in the next financing.  i.e. you raise form a convertible with liq pref that kicks in in an M&A but goes away on conversion

4) I would rather do a priced down round than do a flat to a priced flat round with liquidation preferences that alters all future liquidation preferences
