One of the misconceptions in that a priced round is better from a dilution standpoint for a founder than a standard Post-Money Safe.  In reality it actually depends on a number factors that most founders wonâ€™t have a good command of at the time theyâ€™re raising their first Safe.  These are:

- How many SAFE rounds will you raise
- How much option pool will the Series Pre-Seed investor demand
- Whether a founder will depart the company before the next priced round

Letâ€™s dive into these in more detail.  

## Priced Round Dilution Across Multiple Rounds

Imagine A VC invests $2 million at a priced round with a valuation of $8M pre-money/$10M post money.  The price per share will be 8M / 2,000 shares or $4.  The investor will receive 500,000 shares:

|  | Starting ownership (shares) | Starting ownership (%) | Ownership after Investment (shares) | Ownership after Investment (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 50%  | 1,000,000 | 40%  |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 50% | 1,000,000 | 40%  |
| Seed Investor |  |  | 500,000 | 20%  |
|  | 2,000,000 | 100% | 2,500,000 | 100% |

Now imagine that a year has passed by, the company has limped along and needs additional capital. A new investor decides to invest an additional $2M *at the same valuation as before.*  

|  | Ownership before  Investment (shares) | Ownership before Investment (%) | New shares | Ownership after Investment (shares) | Ownership after Investment (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 40%  |  | 1,000,000 | 33.33%  |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 40%  |  | 1,000,000 | 33.33%  |
| Seed Investor | 500,000 | 20%  |  | 500,000 | 16.67%  |
| Seed Investor 2 |  |  | 500,000 | 500,000 | 16.67% |
|  | 2,500,000 | 100% |  | 3,000,000 | 100% |

The new investor has now bought 500,000 shares, or 16.67%, and diluted all the existing shareholders equally by 16.67%. 

## Safe Dilution Across Multiple Rounds

Now Imagine the same scenario takes place but using the SAFE instrument, which provides the investor with the right to be granted these shares at a future round.

 The first VC will invests $2 million with a post-money SAFE and a $10M cap. Then, a year later, the second VC will also invests $2 million with a post-money SAFE and a $10M cap.  When these rounds convert, each investor will get 20% and the difference in the dilution will be borne by the founders and existing shareholders

|  | Ownership before  Investment (shares) | Ownership before Investment (%) | New shares | Ownership after Investment (shares) | Ownership after Investment (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder A | 1,000,000 | 40%  |  | 1,000,000 | 30% |
| Founder B | 1,000,000 | 40%  |  | 1,000,000 | 30% |
| Seed Investor |  |  | 666,664 | 666,666 | 20% |
| Seed Investor 2 |  |  | 666,664 | 666,666 | 20% |
|  | 2,500,000 | 100% |  | 3,333,332 | 100% |

ðŸ“¢ Note: When YC first introduced the SAFE agreement in 2013, it followed a pre-money capitalization. In essence, it mimicked a priced round where the pre-money or share price was agreed on and additional investments diluted all shareholders. In 2018 YC introduced the post-money safe.

For a company raising just one SAFE round, thereâ€™s effectively no repercussions: an investor willing to invest $2M on $8MÂ *pre-*money is presumably willing to invest $2M on $10MÂ *post-*money, with the same resulting ownership of 20%.

But things are different when multiple SAFE rounds are involved. Imagine the company raising an additional $2M on the same note a year later. Under the old SAFE agreement, the company will have effectively raised $4M on $8M pre / $12M post with investors owning 33.33% and founders 66.66%. Under the new agreement, the company will have effectively raised $4M on $10M post with investors owning 40% and founders 60%. Why the difference? Because in post-money agreement, subsequent SAFE investors dilute the founders but do not dilute the existing SAFE holders.

When a founder raises two different rounds via a SAFE, the dilution to the founder can be significantly higher compared to raising two priced rounds. This is because the SAFEs only dilute the founder and do not dilute each other. In a priced round, the dilution is spread across all existing shareholders, including those who hold SAFEs. As a result, each new SAFE round adds a layer of dilution solely to the founder's shares, compounding the impact. Conversely, in priced rounds, the dilution is shared among all shareholders proportionately, leading to a more evenly distributed dilution effect.

- Priced rounds are also better for the founder if you will do multiple rounds of SAFEsÂ (i.e. you will raise $3M on $20M post, and then another $5M on $30M a year later because the dilution hit will only apply to the existing shareholders/the safes won't dilute each other ).
- But if the founder is raising just one round of financing then the dilution will be near identical between a Safe and a priced round (dilution will actually be larger in the priced round because of the option pool requirement)

# 

- Separately, a SAFE is better for the founder for three ways
    - (A) Simpler / less onerous (you won't negotiateÂ  founder vesting/option pool/etc).
    - (B) More control (you can sell the company withoutÂ needing any shareholder consent)
    - (C) better dilution in the eventÂ a cofounder drops out before the next roundÂ (Basically their shares will go back to you / existing shareholdersÂ but not to the safe holders, while if you raise a priced round then a founder drops out their shares "go back" to everyoneÂ pro-ratedly).

Our take: itâ€™s really 6 one way half dozen the other. Itâ€™s more important to have the right investors around the table 

## Your Lawyers

Your counsel will always want you to raise via a priced round because it allows them to iterate on complex documents and charge substantially more legal fees than via a Safe.  .
