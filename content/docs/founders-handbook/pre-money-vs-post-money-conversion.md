Name: Pre-money vs Post-money Conversion

---


In 2018 YC replaced the original Pre-money safe (where investors and company agree on the _pre-money_ valuation) with the Post-money safe (where investors and company agree on the _post-money_ valuation the safe converts). The key difference between the two conversion methods is around calculating the ownership being sold in an investment:

- If an investor and company agree on a **pre-money** valuation, then an investor's ownership is a function of their investment, the pre-money valuation _and_ the size of round (and all other rounds until conversion).
- But if an investor and company agree on a **post-money** valuation, then an investor's ownership is a function of their investment and the post-money valuation _irrespective_ of the round size or any other rounds taking place until conversion.

For a company raising just one SAFE round, there's effectively no difference: an investor who invests $2M on $8M _pre_-money is presumably willing to invest $2M on $10M _post_-money, with the same resulting ownership of 20%. But things are different when multiple SAFE rounds are involved. Let's look at two examples


## Conversion on a Pre-money Basis


Consider a company that's in the example above.  The company first issues a $2M SAFE  converting on a pre-money basis.  The company cap table looks as follows


|               | Starting ownership (shares) | Starting ownership (%) | First Safe Round                         | Ownership after everything converts (shares) | Ownership after everything converts (%) |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Founder A     | 1,000,000                   | 50%                    |                                          | 1,000,000                                    | 40%                                     |
| Founder B     | 1,000,000                   | 50%                    |                                          | 1,000,000                                    | 40%                                     |
| Seed Investor |                             |                        | The right to buy 2/(8+2) = 20% of equity | 500,000                                      | 20%                                     |
|               | 2,000,000                   | 100%                   |                                          | 2,500,000                                    | 100%                                    |


Now the same company decides to raise an additional $2M on the same terms a year later from Seed Investor 2. Under the pre-money conversion, the company will have effectively raised two different $2M notes on $8M pre-money, so effectively $4M on $8M pre/$12M post, with Investors owning 33.33% and founders 66.66%.  Basically, in a pre-money conversion, investors dilute each other in addition to diluting existing shareholders.

Cap Table Example


Here's the mechanics of what actually happens:

- Initially, investor 1 bought the right to buy $2M of equity on $8M pre (or $10M post)
- Then Investor 2 got the right to buy $2M of equity on $8M pre. But the company is now valued at $12M post. So Investor 2 gets 2/12 = 16.66%. Additionally, investor 1's ownership is getting diluted by Investor 2's 16.66%. So now their ownership is 20% * (1-0.1666) = 16.66%

The dilution keeps going on as the company raises additional convertible or SAFE rounds until the first priced rounds takes place. And the math is recursiveâ€”getting a bit more complicated with each round.  And that's why investors and founders demanded a better mechanism.


## Conversion on a Post-money Basis


Let's take the same example but where investors agree on the post-money valuation. Under this scenario, each investor will have invested $2M on $10M post for a 20% ownership. The company will have effectively raised $4M on $10M post with investors owning 40% and founders 60%. Why the difference? Because in post-money agreement, the second SAFE investor dilutes the existing shareholders but do not dilute the first SAFE holders since the agreement is on the post-money not the pre-money.

## Conclusion


Post-money conversion offers investors and founders clarity on their respective ownership before priced round occurs, while pre-money conversion provides more favorable dilution to founders across multiple rounds. That said, that ship has largely sailed. In recent years, pre-money SAFEs and convertible rounds have virtually disappeared, with post-money SAFEs now dominating over 95% of Silicon Valley financing.
