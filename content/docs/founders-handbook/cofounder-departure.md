tldr; while often viewed as a crisis, founder separation can be necessary for a company's evolution. But the CEO must handle it with speed, care, and grace—and must reach a separation agreement with the departing founder. If not executed properly, a founder separation can blow up the business. 


## Why Founder Departures Happen


The more founders a startup has, the more likely one will depart or be forced out early in the company's life. Founder disagreements arise for various reasons, but they typically fall into three main categories:

- Disagreement over a founder's role within the company. The classic example here is a person who was brought onboard as a cofounder because they had the original idea or were industry experts, but who turned out to not have the skills to be a startup leader—because they don't have the functional skills or the startup midnset. Remarkably, this reason is also the most easily mitigated early on if the founders can have the hard conversation upfront.
- Performance gaps, particularly as the skills required to scale a company evolve. A classic example is a founding engineer who can build the initial product but lacks the engineering leadership skills needed to manage the company's growing engineering team.
- Last is general lack of alignment over strategy or vision. Typically this materializes when the startup is unable to find product market fit—and the founders gravitate to different ideas.

## The Five Steps of Founder Transition 


How a CEO handles a co-founder's departure can make the difference between a smooth transition and organizational collapse. Here are the steps you need to follow


### 1. Communicate well before the decision.


If the co-founder receives the news as a complete shock, it signals your failure as CEO to address ongoing disagreements or dissatisfaction. And the more of a surprise the transition is, the messier it turns. So before you get to the decision, make sure to voice your concern to your co-founder and give them the opportunity to address it. This advice holds true for how you manage all your other employees as well. 


### 2. Get good advice  


Reach out to your senior investors/advisors/angels (and your board members if you have them). This step serves two different purposes: getting advice and informing your stake holders.  

- When talking to your investors, ideally you're asking for their advice on executing on the decision, not asking them to weight in on the decision. This decision is yours as the CEO to make.  They will typically be most concerned with the sustainability of the business and how quickly you can replace your co-founder. Some might offer to mediate which can be helpful.
- If you do have board, you need to get their buy-in.  Technically the board has the power to remove the CEO (although in early stage startups investors seldom have the voting power). Still make sure the board is aware. And again the more of a surprise the decision is to them, the more eyebrows it will raise.
- Last, talk to your lawyer. They will focus on making sure you CYA with employment termination, separation, etc. Be prepared for a hefty legal bill. Separation agreements from a top tier firm typically cost $25K-$50K.  Not having a separation agreement meanwhile could cost you the entire business.

### 3. Come up with a comp package and a transition plan.


Before getting into the comp package details it's important to understand what your co-founder needs from the company and what you as a founder CEO need from your departing co-founder. 


Your co-founder will typically want

- Respect and prestige: they probably expect to maintain their co-founder title, they want to have some control over the story/narrative, they might want to remain involved in some capacity as an advisor to the company, etc.
- Some equity: probably more than you're willing to give them (more on that later)
- Some cash compensation: based on their financial situation

What you want from your co-founder

- A fully signed separation agreement: otherwise the founder will maintain some legal claim on their equity which will only become more valuable with time.  The story of Facebook's tribulations with Mark Zuckerburg and Eduardo Saverin sheds light on how long this can go for and how expensive
- Their future vote: this is one of the bigger mistakes founders make—assuming once the co-founder is gone they're dead weight. Because they still hold shares, you will often need their voting in future financings. Also when it comes to an M&A, their vote can be particulally critical in approving your 280-G compensation package.

Too often we see founders getting bogged down by how much equity a departing founder gets even though they didn't perform to par.  That's the wrong framing.  A disagreement doesn't necessarily mean you were right and they were wrong; it may simply mean your views are incompatible—and you, as the CEO, gets to stay and they leave. 


So before you think through what's fair and what's not fair, try to put yourself in your co-founders shoes. They are waking up to work one day at a startup that they have worked very hard on and which is an integral part of their personal identity only to be told their services are no longer wanted.  And then you need them to part with grace and to sign a full release of all claims against the company so you're not left with a legal overhang in every future financing and a blocking vote in an M&A.  That's a tall oder.  Your job at this point is to come up with a package that is generous enough to give the departing founder the respect and compensation they deserve without being too generous that you handicap the business.  


In general, most separation package offer a combination of cash, equity, title (maintain co-founder, transition to advisor, etc) and then a slew of legalese around non-disparagement,   


### 4. Execute on the transition 


How you handle the conversation will carry a lot of weight.     Critical information, relationships, and responsibilities must be systematically transferred before the founder's exit. This process should be carefully planned and executed.


### 5. Getting Help When Things Go Wrong


Even with careful planning, some transitions can become contentious. If your co-founder becomes uncooperative or threatens legal action, stay calm and professional. Here's how to handle a deteriorating situation:

- Listen actively to their grievances - there might be legitimate concerns you haven't considered
- Engage trusted investors or advisors as mediators - they often have experience with similar situations and can provide neutral perspective
- Don't let negotiations drag on indefinitely - a founder dispute hanging over your company can deter future investors and harm operations
- Consider bringing in a professional mediator if internal attempts at resolution fail

Remember that a disgruntled founder with significant equity can create serious problems for future fundraising rounds or M&A opportunities. You need to reaching a resolution quickly and decisively.


### 6. Start the replacement  


If the departing founder owns a crucial function (say engineering or sales) they will need to be replaced right away to maintain momentum.  Start recruiting in stealth as soon as you have made the decision. 


The most important thing to remember is that while the transition may feel overwhelming and costly in the moment, there is light at the end of the tunnel. With a nimbler team, less friction,  and potentially new executives who are more aligned with your vision, your company will thrive and you will never back. The extra equity or cash compensation given to your departing co-founder will ultimately be a small price to pay.


While founder departures are challenging moments in a startup's journey, they don't have to be catastrophic. With proper leadership, clear communication, and careful planning, companies can emerge stronger and more focused. The key lies in viewing these transitions not as failures, but as natural evolution points in a company's growth story.
