The captable worksheet is an open-source, client-side tool to help founders model their SAFE and priced rounds. The module is available on [github](https://github.com/1984vc/startup-finance) and 1984 hosts an instance at [https://1984.vc/docs/cap-table-worksheet](https://1984.vc/docs/cap-table-worksheet)

Design Goals:

1. Users can enter their cap table details and model different fundraising scenarios
2. Users can share this cap table with co-founders and investors easily and securely
3. No data is stored anywhere at 1984, including log files

How it works:

- The captable worksheet stores the entire state encoded in the URL
- Each iteration of the cap table is also stored in the browser's local storage for easy retrieval
- If users want a permanent copy beyond just saving the URL, they can use the "share by email" option, which sends the cap table details to their email. 1984 will have a record of the email address but not the email content or captable information.
