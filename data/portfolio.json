The team were shipping code at warp speed. 1984 co-led the round with YC. Since then, Posthog has become the de facto leader in product analytics and have dramatically expanded their offering to incorporate the functionality of Amplitude, Segment, Launch Darkly and Fivetran combined."

Brad was an incredibly pedigreed robotics expert, having previously led Amazon's warehouse robotics business and then take the helm as CTO of Scale AI. His Amazonian ethos of quickly showing business value (rather than indulging a science project) and his unmatchable expertise gave us the confidence to invest. In just 18 months since, the company has shipped working robots for early customers and has raised over $100M from Sequoia and General Catalyst"

This inspired an idea: to offer clinics the chance to provide their patients with the specialty pharmacy experience they deserve. Ogi teamed up with Tesh Kullar, former head of provider solutions at Flatiron Health, to build a company that is steadily becoming a category-defining player in the industry."
