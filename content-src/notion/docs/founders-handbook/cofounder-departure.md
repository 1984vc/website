tldr; while often viewed as a crisis, founder separation happen more often and can be necessary for a company's evolution. But the CEO must handle it with speed, care, and graceâ€”and must reach a separation agreement with the departing founders so they don't blow up the business. 


## Why Founder Departures Happen


The more founders a startup has, the more likely one will depart or be forced out early in the company's life. Founder disagreements arise for various reasons, but they typically fall into three main categories:

- Having the wrong co-founder. A classic example is someone brought onboard as a cofounder because they had the original idea or industry expertise, but who turns out to lack the skills needed to be a startup leaderâ€”whether that's functional skills or the startup mindset. This issue can often be prevented if founders have honest conversations about roles and expectations upfront.
- Skill gaps that emerge as the company scales. A common example is a founding engineer who excels at building the initial product but struggles to develop the leadership abilities needed to manage a growing engineering team.
- A general lack of alignment over strategy or vision. Typically this materializes when the startup is unable to find product market fitâ€”and the founders gravitate to different ideas.

## The Five Steps of Founder Transition 


How a CEO handles a co-founder's departure can make the difference between a smooth transition and organizational collapse. Here are the steps you need to follow.


### 1. Communicate Well Before the Decision


A co-founder should never receive this news as a complete shockâ€”if they do, it indicates your failure as CEO to address ongoing disagreements or dissatisfaction. The more surprising the transition, the messier it becomes. Before reaching this decision, voice your concerns clearly to your co-founder and give them a fair chance to address them. This principle applies to managing all employees, not just co-founders. 


### 2. Get Good Advice  


Reach out to your senior investors, advisors, and angels (and board members if you have them). This step serves two purposes: getting advice and informing your stakeholders.  

- When talking to your investors, ideally you're asking for their advice on executing on the decision, not asking them to weight in on the decision. This decision is yours as the CEO to make.  They will typically be most concerned with the sustainability of the business and how quickly you can replace your co-founder. Some might offer to mediate which can be helpful.
- If you do have board, you need to get their buy-in.  Technically the board has the power to remove the CEO (although in early stage startups investors seldom have the voting power). Still make sure the board is aware. And again the more of a surprise the decision is to them, the more eyebrows it will raise.
- Finally, consult your lawyer. They will ensure you're properly protected with employment termination, separation agreements, and other legal documentation. Expect significant legal costsâ€”separation agreements from top-tier firms typically range from $25,000 to $50,000. However, proceeding without a separation agreement will put your business' future at risk.

### 3. Come up With a Comp Package and a Transition Plan


Before getting into the comp package details it's important to understand what your co-founder needs from the company and what you as a founder CEO need from your departing co-founder. 


Your co-founder will typically want

- Respect and prestige: they will want to maintain their co-founder title, they want to have some control over the story/narrative, they might want to remain involved in some capacity as an advisor to the company, etc.
- Some equity: probably more than you're willing to give them (more on that later)
- Some cash compensation: based on their financial situation

What you want from your co-founder

- A fully signed separation agreement: otherwise the founder will maintain a legal claim on their equity which will only become more valuable with time.  The story of Facebook's tribulations with Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo SaverinÂ sheds light on how long this can go forâ€”and how expensive
- Their future vote: This is one of the bigger mistakes founders makeâ€”assuming a co-founder becomes irrelevant once they're gone. Because a departing co-founder still holds common shares, you will often need their vote in future financings. When it comes to M&A, their vote can be particularly critical in approving your 280-G compensation package.

Too often we see founders getting bogged down by how much equity a departing founder gets even though they didn't perform to par.  That's the wrong framing.  A disagreement doesn't necessarily mean you were right and they were wrong; it may simply mean your views are incompatibleâ€”and you, as the CEO, gets to stay and they leave. 


In general, most separation package offers a combination of the following:

- Cash: The range can be anywhere from 2 weeks to a year. Think through how long they've been with the company, their financial situation and how employable they are.
- Equity: expect to provide a little more equity than they have vested in the early days, and less than they have fully vested later on. Note that the effect of a founder's departure on the remaining founder's equity varies greatly based on whether the initial investment was a priced round vs a SAFE or other convertible instruments, [more details here](/176829231d098007a3d7f4c6e257ce9b)

 If the founder hasn't been at the company for the full year cliff, it's often wise to grant them a few months worth of vestingâ€”say 2%.  On the other hand if the founder has  significant equity vested before the A, you want to buy back their shares so they leave with no more than 5% of the cap table, otherwise their holding will be perceived as "dead weight" by the Series A lead.

- Title (maintain co-founder, stay on as an advisor, etc)
- Controlling the narrative (i.e. we have mutually decided to part ways, etc)
- Last, a slew of legalese around non-disparagement, non-disclosure, etc.

The most important thing to remember is that while the transition may feel overwhelming and costly in the moment, you will never look back. With a nimbler team, less friction,  and potentially new executives who are more aligned with your vision, your company will thrive and you will never look back. The extra equity or cash compensation given to your departing co-founder will ultimately be a small price to pay.


{{< callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡" >}}
You should agree on the high-level compensation package first before engaging lawyers, and ideally put it in writing through email, SMS, or Slack. This advice holds true for most transactions: always agree on commercial terms with your counterparty before bringing in the lawyers. Otherwise, deals will drag on indefinitely, and obsessing over legal details can distract from negotiating the important commercial terms.

### 4. Execute on the transition 


How you handle the conversation will impact the outcome. And Having empathy is a key. Put yourself in your co-founder's shoes: they've poured their heart into this startup which has become part of their identity. Now they're suddenly being told their services are no longer needed. Yet you need them to exit gracefully and sign a full release of claims. That's a tall order. Your task is to show appropriate respect and create an enticing package for the departing founder while ensuring it doesn't handicap the business's future.  Some specifics:

- Show respect: if your co-founder is half way across the country, fly over to see them in person. Allocate enough time for the discussion.
- Get straight to the point: You've reached the conclusion this isn't the right fit and have decided to part ways.
- Own the decision. Don't blame it on other co-founders or the board or the investors.
- Listen. Don't interrupt.
- **Focus the discussion on the terms of the separation, not the reasons behind the separation: this advice holds true for how you should part with all employees, not just co-founders.**
- Don't push them to sign anything on the spot. Tell them you will follow up with the separation terms and set up a follow-up checkpoint a day or two later.

### 5. Start the replacement  


If the departing founder owns a crucial function (say engineering or sales) they will need to be replaced right away to maintain momentum.  Start recruiting in stealth as soon as you have made the decision. Involve your investors to vet and close prospects. 


## Getting Help When Things Go Wrong


Even with careful planning, some transitions can become contentious. If your co-founder becomes uncooperative or threatens legal action, stay calm and professional. Here's how to handle a deteriorating situation:

- Listen actively to their grievances - there might be legitimate concerns you haven't considered
- Engage trusted investors or advisors as mediators - they often have experience with similar situations and can provide neutral perspective
- Don't let negotiations drag on indefinitely - a founder dispute hanging over your company can deter future investors and harm operations
- Consider bringing in a professional mediator if internal attempts at resolution fail

Remember that a disgruntled founder with significant equity can create serious problems for future fundraising rounds or M&A opportunities. You need to reach a resolution quickly and decisively.  


While founder departures are challenging moments in a startup's journey, they don't have to be catastrophic. With careful planning, clear communication, and a good dose of empathy, companies can emerge stronger and more focused. The key lies in viewing these transitions not as failures, but as natural evolution points in a company's growth story.
