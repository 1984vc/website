Startups are bought, not sold. However, there are many things you can do as a founder to set your company up for a successful exit. The key is thinking about it ahead of time. Here are a few steps to guide you through the process.


## Build Relationships

- Create a list of potential acquirers. Your acquirers tend to fall into a few buckets: larger competitors, partners/customers of your products, and larger companies that are threatened by your competitors. The third bucket, while less obvious, can be one of the most strategic outcomes.
- Start building the relationships with these businessÂ _well_Â before you need to get acquired. Think a year or two. If they only have 3â€“6 months of cash left and you want to start an M&A, you will end up with a fire sale for pennies.
- Make sure you're building the relationships with right decision makersâ€”namely a CEO, GM, or a CXO level executives.  Don't waster your time with Corp Dev teams; while they execute on the M&A decision, they don't actually initiate it.
- Consider partnerships that could lead to acquisition.

Make sure to understand what an acquirerÂ _can_Â pay. Companies typically spend at most 1-2% of their market cap on an M&A. If your competitor is publicly trading at $8B, $100-$150M is probably the larger end of what they can spend.

## Start the Process


Working with experienced M&A advisors is crucial - they can help navigate complex terms, provide good tax advice, and maximize your company's value ([See Legal Consideration for M&A](/docs/founders-handbook/mergers-and-acquisitions/legal-considerations/)).


You should put together a well-organized data room containing all relevant company information, from financial statements to customer contracts, will streamline due diligence and build credibility with potential acquirers.


## Position Your Company Around the Combined Value


Many founders focus too narrowly on their team, current revenue, or product features when positioning for acquisition. However, talent, revenue, or product acquisitions are actually some of the less valuable M&A outcomes. The highest value comes from positioning the acquisition as a strategic threat or a defensive move.

Start by telling a compelling "1+1=11" story - demonstrating how combining your company with the acquirer can create exponential value. For example, highlight how your product could drive massive revenue when distributed through the acquirer's existing customer base, how your technology could transform their core business, or how your team's expertise could accelerate their strategic initiatives. Paint a picture of transformative potential rather than just current metrics.


## Drive the Deal Structure

- Start thinking about the right structure and whether an asset acquisition, stock acquisition or a full merger is the appropriate structure here. For more on these seeÂ [Structuring M&A](https://1984.vc/docs/founders-handbook/mergers-and-acquisitions/structuring/)
- Think about what matters to you beyond just the cash and consideration such as timing of payments, earnouts, title and role, etc. For a comprehensive list of the typical M&A terms seeÂ [Terms To Negotiate in an M&A Transaction](https://1984.vc/docs/founders-handbook/mergers-and-acquisitions/terms/)
- Always get a second bidder.

The moment you get an LOI, your priority must turn to getting a second term sheet ASAP to create leverage in the negotiation. Reach out to your partners and other potential acquirers. Tell them you value their partnership and wanted them to know you've gotten an offer for an acquisition. Never say the name of the acquirer. In certain situations you can signal the price range.

## Convince Your Investors


In certain situations, your investors may be hesitant to sell if they perceive the outcome as less favorable than the company is worth. You can use a mix of fear and greed here: fear of your company's outcome as a standalone entity and greed about the acquirer's stock potential if it's a stock acquisition.

If you have only raised financing through SAFEs, you generally can execute the M&A without investor approval since you control the common share and the board. However, once you have raised a priced round, you typically need both board approvalÂ _and_Â majority approval from preferred shareholders (i.e., investors) to proceed with the merger.

## Post-Deal Considerations

1. The period between signing and closing is typically the most demanding phase in the life of the founder, requiring extensive documentation, legal reviews, and detailed integration planning. Expect 4-8 weeks of around the clock work dealing with every detail from a missing NDA for a consultant you hired five years ago to replacing an open source module in your codebase the acquirers deems too risky
2. Prepare your team for the transition. Their biggest two questions are how much will I be making and is my job secure. Addressing concerns about job security and changes in company culture. Set expectations about the new operating world. And if the merger includes layoffs plan for these conversation carefully.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Don't neglect your core business during the process. Ideally no one knows about the process aside from your cofounder if you're early (or your CFO and a handful of key folks if you're late stage). This news will spread like wildfire and will effectively pause your company'r progress.
2. Don't wait until you're forced to sell.
