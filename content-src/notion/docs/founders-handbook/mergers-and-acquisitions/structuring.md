A threshold issue to address in any M&A transaction is the structure of the deal. The three principal ways to acquire a business consist of (i) an asset acquisition, (ii) a stock acquisition, and (iii) a merger, each of which is further described below. In any event, you should consult with your legal counsel and tax advisors to determine which structure is best for your transaction given the numerous commercial, process/consent and tax issues that each structure poses.


·   	_Asset acquisition_—In an asset acquisition, a buyer acquires specific assets and liabilities of the selling company as listed in the acquisition agreement, an asset purchase agreement. After the deal closes, the buyer and seller maintain their corporate structures and the seller retains those assets and liabilities not purchased by the buyer. Buyers may favor asset acquisitions for a number of reasons, including: (i) the flexibility to pick and choose specific assets and liabilities; (ii) no wasted money on unwanted assets; and (iii) a lower risk of assuming unknown or undisclosed liabilities (however, even when a deal is structured as an asset sale, a buyer may sometimes become liable for assets not specifically listed in the asset purchase agreement under a concept known as successor liability). On the other hand, asset acquisitions are typically more complicated and time-consuming than stock acquisitions because: (a) assigning specific assets requires separate transfers with different mechanics and formalities; and (b) numerous third party consents are often required since most of a selling company's agreements likely contain anti-assignment clauses (whereas stock acquisitions only require consents when change of control clauses are present, which are generally much less common). From a tax perspective, buyers generally prefer asset deals because they acquire a basis in the acquired assets equal to the purchase price paid plus certain other items, which is often higher than the basis that the selling company had in those assets (i.e. a "stepped-up basis"). This stepped-up basis enables a buyer to take greater depreciation and amortization deductions on such assets, and reduces the amount of taxable income or gain (or increases the amount of loss) on a later sale or other disposition of the assets. On the other hand, when the selling company is taxed as a C-corporation, it generally recognizes taxable income, gain, or loss on the sale of its assets and its stockholders generally recognize taxable income, gain, or loss on the distribution of any proceeds from the sale (i.e. there is potentially double taxation in an asset deal), and thus such companies generally prefer to structure a transaction as a stock acquisition (which results in a single level of taxation at the stockholder level). However, if the selling company is a partnership, limited liability company (i.e. taxed as a pass-through entity), or an S-corporation, any taxable income, gain, or loss realized from the sale of the assets generally passes through to (in other words, would be taxed directly to) the company's partners, members, or stockholders as a single level of taxation, and thus such companies are more likely to be willing to structure a transaction as an asset acquisition. Finally, in addition to potential double taxation, many asset acquisitions are subject to sales, use, and other transfer taxes under state law. Although the selling company generally is responsible for these taxes as a matter of law, they may be shifted to the buyer by contract.


·   	_Stock acquisition_—In a stock acquisition, a buyer acquires the target company's stock directly from the selling stockholders through a stock purchase agreement and thus acquires all of the target company's assets, rights, and liabilities (the target company maintains its corporate existence and becomes a subsidiary of the buyer). Although this additional liability creates some risk for buyers, a stock acquisition is good for buyers desiring to acquire a going concern, particularly if the target company has a relatively low number of stockholders. Moreover, to shield themselves from target company liabilities, buyers often: (i) maintain the target company as a separate subsidiary; and (ii) negotiate certain contractual protections into the stock purchase agreement, such as indemnities and escrow provisions. Stock acquisitions are usually simpler than asset acquisitions and mergers—for example, unless a target company agreement specifically contains a change of control clause, there is generally no need for third party consents, and unlike with mergers, there are relatively few statutory requirements applicable to stock acquisitions. However, negotiations can get cumbersome and time consuming if the target company has a relatively high number of stockholders. Stock acquisitions generally result in a single level of taxation for a target company's stockholders, and thus are the generally preferred transaction structure for sellers. Stock acquisitions generally do not result in sales, use, or other transfer taxes.


·   	_Merger_—A merger is a stock acquisition in which two companies combine into one legal entity pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement, as a result of which the surviving entity assumes all of the assets, rights, and liabilities of the disappearing entity. The merger process itself is governed by the laws of the states of formation of the entity parties to the merger, and it generally involves more statutory requirements (including detailed filings and appraisal processes), and thus more time and expense, than either an asset transaction or a stock transaction. However, mergers generally only require majority consent from the target company's stockholders for the buyer to obtain 100% of the stock (subject to any additional requirements that may exist in a company's constituent documents, such as class voting rights for a series of stock), and thus may be a preferable option for buyers that want to acquire sole control of a going concern that has many stockholders, especially when some of them may be opposed to selling their stock. Depending on the exact structure of the merger, third party consents generally may or may not be required, and the transaction may be treated as an asset acquisition or a stock acquisition.


Proper structuring of an M&A transaction is a critical initial step in the deal process. Given the numerous commercial, process/consent and tax issues that each type of structure poses, due consideration should be given by all transaction parties and their advisors to this issue, ideally at the outset of the process.

**Terms to Negotiate in an M&A Transaction**


Acquisition agreements in M&A transactions are often long, complex documents. Although each deal has different issues and the treatment of those issues will depend on factors like the nature and structure of the particular transaction and the relative bargaining position of the parties, there are certain key provisions that are commonly negotiated in almost all acquisition agreements.

| Consideration                                              | The most common forms of consideration consist of (i) cash, (ii) promissory note(s) (i.e. debt), (iii) stock, or (iv) any combination of the foregoing. The type of consideration paid often has tax consequences for both the buyer and the seller, and thus tax advisors should be consulted. Generally speaking, sellers prefer the certainty of cash as opposed to the potential upside of stock consideration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Purchase Price Adjustments and Earnouts                    | The purchase price is either fixed at the closing or subject to adjustment thereafter once the value of the target company as of the closing is confirmed. The most common purchase price adjustment is based on the working capital of the target business, but it can be based on other metrics, such as the valuation of specific assets or the level of cash and debt. Earnouts—a mechanism in which at least part of the purchase price is payable after the closing if the target business achieves one or more certain financial or operational targets within a specified period of time—are often used when the parties cannot agree on the value of the target business. Sellers generally prefer the certainty of a fixed purchase price paid entirely at closing, but purchase price adjustments are quite common.
**Founder Tip**: Founders should consider whether and to what extent (e.g. as an employee or consultant, and for how long) they will work for a buyer post-closing. If a founder remains involved in the business following the transaction, he or she may be more willing to entertain an earnout as part of the deal consideration because he/she will still be able to exert (at least some) influence on the results of the business, and thus on the likelihood of achieving the earnout targets. If, on the other hand, a founder wants to completely separate from the business, he/she will more likely prefer not to have an earnout and instead to receive all deal proceeds at or soon after closing. |
| Escrow                                                     | Although buyers can pay the purchase price in full at the closing, part of it is often withheld in an escrow account to secure purchase price adjustments in favor of the buyer or seller indemnification obligations. Common negotiation points include the amount of the escrow, its length and the mechanics for its release. Sellers generally prefer to receive the entirety of the purchase price at the closing and to have no escrow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Scope of Assets and Liabilities (for an Asset Acquisition) | In most asset acquisitions, the buyer acquires only the assets and liabilities it identifies and agrees to acquire and assume. The in-scope assets and liabilities are typically either specifically identified and listed, or the asset purchase agreement states that all of the seller's assets and liabilities are to be transferred to the buyer, except for those specifically excluded. Sellers generally prefer the latter approach because it requires less diligence and reduces the amount of liabilities that will remain with the seller following the closing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Governance/Social Issues                                   | Depending on the exact nature of the transaction, the parties may need to work through key governance/social issues regarding the operation of the combined businesses post-closing, such as the name of the entity, the location of its headquarters, the composition of its leadership and board of directors, the role and title of the founder, whether the seller's brand and product will remain in existence, etc. The outcome of these types of issues tends to be very deal specific and dependent on the relative bargaining position of the parties and whether the founder will remain involved in the business following closing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Representations and Warranties                             | Representations and warranties are statements of fact and assurances made by the parties that, among other things, (i) disclose material information about the parties and the stock or assets and liabilities being sold, (ii) allocate risk between the parties, and (iii) serve as the basis for an indemnification claim in case of a breach of contract by one of the parties. They are usually the longest part of the acquisition agreement and are often heavily negotiated. Although buyers do give representations and warranties, those of sellers tend to be far more extensive. Buyers generally seek to obtain comprehensive and unqualified representations and warranties from sellers, whereas sellers seek to minimize the number and scope of their representations and warranties through qualifications such as materiality, knowledge and time.
**Founder Tip**: Founders should make sure to spend sufficient time closely reviewing the seller's representations and warranties with legal counsel to confirm their accuracy, as these are often the source of potential liability down the road (i.e. indemnification claims by the buyer).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Closing Conditions                                         | If the signing and closing of the transaction do not happen simultaneously, each party will require that the other satisfy certain conditions prior to closing. Some of these conditions apply to both parties, whereas others only bind one of the parties. If a party has not satisfied a condition applicable to it, then the other party generally is not obligated to close the transaction until the condition is satisfied. Sellers typically prefer there to be fewer conditions to closing in order to increase the likelihood that the closing will actually occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Covenants                                                  | A covenant is a promise to take an action (an affirmative covenant) or to refrain from taking an action (a restrictive covenant). Certain covenants apply between signing and closing, such as obligations on the seller regarding how to operate the target business, whereas others apply post-closing, such as non-compete and non-solicitation obligations on the seller. In general, buyers prefer having more covenants in place to manage the behavior of sellers both before and after closing, while sellers prefer fewer covenants.
**Founder Tip**: Founders should make sure to closely review and consider the impact of all covenants to ensure that they will be abided by, especially any of those that will affect future conduct by the founders post-closing, such as non-compete and non-solicitation obligations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Indemnification                                            | Indemnification is a post-closing remedy for losses incurred under an acquisition agreement typically arising from: (i) a breach of or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty; (ii) a failure to perform a covenant; and/or (iii) an agreed-to allocation of liabilities between the parties (such as a particular litigation or tax issue of the target company). The indemnification provisions tend to be one of the most heavily negotiated sections of the acquisition agreement. Although both parties typically have indemnification obligations, it is more likely that the buyer will seek recovery than the seller because the latter provides far more extensive representations and warranties than the former. In general, Buyers seek to obtain comprehensive and unqualified indemnification provisions, whereas sellers seek to minimize the scope of their indemnities through limitations such as caps, baskets (thresholds or deductibles), and shorter survival periods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
