Let's take a deeper dive into the mechanics of raising a subsequent round. Let's assume that seed investors have bought 20% of the company. Several employees have joined and were granted a total of say 7% leaving 3% remaining option pool.


Given we have covered SAFE conversion  already, in this example we assume the seed round was a priced one to simplify the calculations and emphasize the points on option pool and prorate. But the effect is the same.


Our starting cap table now looks like the following:


|                       | Ownership before Series A (shares) | Ownership before Series A (%) |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Founder A             | 1,000,000                          | 35%                           |
| Founder B             | 1,000,000                          | 35%                           |
| Employees             | 200,000                            | 7%                            |
| Seed Investor         | 571,428                            | 20%                           |
| Available Option Pool | 85,714                             | 3%                            |
|                       | 2,857,142                          | 100%                          |


Next, the founders agree with the Series A lead on an $8M investment at a $40M post money valuation. The new investor will buy enough new shares to own 20% of the cap table which translates to 714,286 shares (PPS is 32,000,000 / 2,857,142 = $11.2) and the investment would only dilute each shareholder by 20% (8/40). So founders ownership would go from 35% to 28% (0.8*35), etc. And the cap table would look as following:


|                       | Ownership before Series A (shares) | Ownership before Series A (%) | New Series A Shares | Ownership after Series A (shares) | Ownership after Series A (%) |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Founder A             | 1,000,000                          | 35%                           |                     | 1,000,000                         | 28%                          |
| Founder B             | 1,000,000                          | 35%                           |                     | 1,000,000                         | 28%                          |

| Seed Investor         | 571,428                            | 20%                           |                     | 571,428                           | 16%                          |

However, there are two problems with this cap table.  First, the option pool has now been diluted down to 2.4%, barely enough for the number of new hires needed as part of this cash infusion. Additionally, the existing investors have also been diluted down to 16% but they often have pro-rata rights in the subsequent round. Addressing both problems will increase the dilution to the founders further.


## Refreshing the option pool


Let's start with the option pool. In order to create another 10% option pool, which is very common in a Series A, the company will need to reserve enough shares such that the option pool after getting diluted by the Series A investor will be 10%.  In this case the number is 354,286 new shares.

But in order to maintain the Series A investor's target ownership of 20%, the number of Series A shares now have to go up from 714,286 shares to 791,837 (the dollar invested will be the same but the price per share will go down to $10.10), and the resulting cap table will end up with 1,146,123 new shares or a total dilution of _**1,146,123**_/_**3,959,183 ~ 29%**_


{{< callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ“¢" >}}
For those interested in dilution math, Shouldn't the final dilution just be 20% for the new investor + 7% option pool expansion = 27%? the reason the number is 29% and not 27% is that these new shares must dilute the existing shareholder, and not dilute the Series A investor or the available option pool so they maintain their 20% and 10% respectively.  In other words, existing shareholders are taking on more of the dilution.

## Dealing with pro rata


Now if the seed investors also decides to maintain their 20% ownership, they will need to participate in the round.  The company now must issue additional shares to seed investors, the series A investor and allocate more options in the option pool. To address all these needs, the company will end up issuing a total of 1,542,858 new shares resulting in a cap table with 4,400,400 shares.  Seed and A investors will both end up at 20%.  But the founders will get hit by a whopping 35% dilution (1,542,858/4,400,400)

It is not uncommon for founders to get hit with 25-30% total dilution in a Series A round. But fortunately there are strategies a founder can follow to limit the dilution
