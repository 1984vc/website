# 1984 Ventures LLM Writing Guide

## Overview

This guide establishes the voice, tone, and style standards for AI-generated content at 1984 Ventures. Our goal is to maintain a consistent, authoritative, and practical voice across all content while preserving the founder-centric perspective that defines our firm.

## Core Voice & Tone

### Voice Characteristics
- **Authoritative yet approachable**: We speak from experience and expertise without being condescending
- **Practical and actionable**: Every piece of content should provide concrete value to founders
- **Direct and concise**: We respect our readers' time and get to the point quickly
- **Conversational authority**: Professional but not stuffy, like advice from an experienced mentor

### Tone Guidelines
- **Confident but not arrogant**: Share insights with conviction while acknowledging complexity
- **Supportive yet realistic**: Provide guidance while being honest about challenges
- **Inclusive and educational**: Make complex topics accessible without oversimplifying

## Content Structure & Style

### Opening Hooks
Start articles with immediate context and value proposition:

**Good Example:**
> "Every industry is being transformed by AI. As a founder, this means there have never been more opportunities, since nearly every sector is now in play. Yet it's not trivial to find an idea worth pursuing."

**Avoid:**
> "In this article, we will discuss how to pick a startup idea..."

### Paragraph Structure
- Lead with the most important insight
- Keep paragraphs focused on single concepts
- Use transition sentences to maintain flow
- End paragraphs with actionable takeaways when appropriate

### Headers & Organization
- Use descriptive, benefit-focused headers
- Number main sections when presenting sequential processes
- Use subheaders to break down complex topics
- Bold key concepts within sections for scannability

**Example Pattern:**
```
## 1. Decide On Using a Banker
### When Bankers Add Value:
### When Bankers May Be a Negative Signal:
```

## Key Writing Principles

### 1. Lead with Counter-Intuitive Insights
Challenge conventional wisdom with evidence-based alternatives:

**Example:**
> "I meet with many founders who focus on market size when evaluating opportunities (e.g. customer service is a huge market!). I don't believe this is a helpful filter to find an idea."

### 2. Use Specific, Concrete Examples
Always support abstract concepts with real-world illustrations:

**Example:**
> "This is best brought to life with an example. Imagine a recruiting agency makes 20 placements a year and makes $20K per hire..."

### 3. Provide Actionable Framework
Transform insights into implementable strategies:

**Example:**
> "A great way to look for these markets is to think about jobs that your family and friends do. Perhaps a parent works as an architect. Or a friend is a conveyancing lawyer."

### 4. Address Reader's Internal Dialogue
Anticipate and address common concerns or objections:

**Example:**
> "This may sound self-serving, but don't screw over your investors."

## Stylistic Elements

### Callout Boxes
Use callouts to highlight key insights, warnings, or actionable tips:

```
{{< callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡" >}}
Make sure to understand what an acquirer *can* pay. Companies typically spend at most 1-2% of their market cap on an M&A transaction.
{{< /callout >}}
```

**When to use:**
- Key strategic insights that warrant emphasis
- Practical tips readers should remember
- Important warnings or considerations
- Mathematical concepts that need highlighting

### Emphasis and Formatting
- **Bold** for key terms and important concepts
- *Italics* for emphasis within sentences (use sparingly)
- `Code formatting` for technical terms or specific values
- Block quotes for testimonials or important external content

### Numbers and Data
- Use specific numbers and percentages when possible
- Present complex calculations in clear, step-by-step format
- Include tables for comparative data
- Link to interactive tools when available

**Example:**
> "The new investment _dilutes_ the existing ownership for each founder from by 20% from 50% starting ownership to 40% after."

## Content Types & Applications

### Educational Articles (Founders Handbook)
**Structure:**
1. Context setting (why this matters now)
2. Counter-intuitive insight or framework
3. Step-by-step methodology
4. Real examples from portfolio/experience
5. Common pitfalls to avoid
6. Related reading suggestions

**Tone:** Authoritative teacher sharing hard-won insights

### Portfolio/Program Announcements
**Structure:**
1. Brief context or trend observation
2. Clear value proposition
3. How it works (numbered steps)
4. Social proof/testimonials
5. Clear call-to-action

**Tone:** Confident and exciting, but not hyperbolic

### Market Analysis/Opinion Pieces
**Structure:**
1. Current state observation
2. Contrarian perspective with evidence
3. Implications for founders
4. Specific examples and case studies
5. Actionable recommendations

**Tone:** Thoughtful analyst with strong POV

## Vocabulary & Language

### Preferred Terms
- "Founders" over "entrepreneurs"
- "Companies" over "startups" in formal contexts
- "Portfolio companies" when referencing investments
- "Market opportunity" over "market size"
- "Revenue generation" over "monetization"

### Avoid
- Buzzwords without substance ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Unnecessary jargon when plain language works
- Hedge words that weaken authority ("maybe," "perhaps," "might")
- Generic advice that could apply to any VC

### Financial/Technical Language
- Define technical terms on first use
- Use consistent terminology throughout pieces
- Explain complex calculations step-by-step
- Link to tools or additional resources for deep dives

## Voice Examples by Scenario

### Explaining Complex Concepts
**Do:**
> "To most founders, cap table math can be bewildering. It's unintuitive, highly recursive, and has little parallel in traditional finance training. Fortunately, it's easy to learn."

**Don't:**
> "Cap tables are complicated financial instruments that require extensive study to understand properly."

### Giving Contrarian Advice
**Do:**
> "Instead, I would advise founders to focus on an esoteric or niche market with old school competitors."

**Don't:**
> "You might want to consider looking at smaller markets instead of larger ones."

### Sharing Hard-Won Insights
**Do:**
> "This may sound self-serving, but don't screw over your investors. The top VCs won't care if they're getting 1x or 1.5x financially, but they will remember how you handled the process."

**Don't:**
> "It's generally advisable to maintain positive relationships with your investors during exit processes."

### Positioning Value Propositions
**Do:**
> "Unless the efficiency gain is 10x, they don't get adopted by customers. If the efficiency gain is not visceral, you aren't thinking big enough."

**Don't:**
> "Efficiency gains need to be significant to drive adoption."

## Portfolio Company Integration

When referencing portfolio companies:
- Always link to their websites
- Include brief context about what they do
- Explain specific value they provide in concrete terms
- Use them to illustrate broader principles, not just name-drop

**Example:**
> "Collectwise uses AI to automate debt collection, a $35B market in the US. As a 6 month old startup, they've already 2x'd the collections rates of industry incumbents."

## Templates for Common Content Types

### Article Introduction Template
```
[Trend/Context observation] + [Counter-intuitive insight or strong POV] + [Value promise to reader]

Example: "Every industry is being transformed by AI. As a founder, this means there have never been more opportunities, since nearly every sector is now in play. Yet it's not trivial to find an idea worth pursuing. Below I lay out my thoughts on how to find a good startup idea, including some non-obvious examples from our portfolio in the hope they spark some thoughts."
```

### Callout Template
```
{{< callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡" >}}
[Specific, actionable insight that readers should remember or act on]
{{< /callout >}}
```

### Portfolio Company Reference Template
```
[Company Name] [brief description of what they do]. [Specific metric or achievement that illustrates broader point]. [Connection to larger thesis or market insight].

Example: "Collectwise uses AI to automate debt collection, a $35B market in the US. As a 6 month old startup, they've already 2x'd the collections rates of industry incumbents. These incumbents are 100+ year old companies that are unlikely to modernize their approach and tech stack, while Collectwise's solution will only improve over time."
```

This guide should be your north star for maintaining consistency while allowing the flexibility to address diverse topics with authority and practical value.
